└─ Keep grass mowed low (<4 inches)

15-30 feet (INTERMEDIATE ZONE):
├─ Fire-resistant trees with high canopy
├─ Clear all ladder fuels (shrubs under trees)
├─ Maintain horizontal spacing: 
│  └─ Trees: 10 feet apart
│  └─ Shrubs: 2x their height apart
├─ Irrigate regularly during dry season
└─ Create green barrier with Zone 1 gardens
```

##### 2. Building Fire Hardening
- [ ] **Roof:** Use non-combustible materials (tile, metal, concrete)
  - Avoid: Thatch, wooden shingles
- [ ] **Walls:** Brick, concrete, stone (already common in India)
- [ ] **Vents:** Install mesh screens (prevent ember entry)
- [ ] **Windows:** Consider double-pane (reduces radiant heat)
- [ ] **Gutters:** Clean regularly, install gutter guards
- [ ] **Eaves:** Enclose eaves to prevent ember lodging

##### 3. Water Access for Fire Suppression
- [ ] **Primary Water Storage:** 5,000-10,000 liter tank near houses
  - Dedicated fire suppression reserve
  - Gravity-fed or pump accessible
  - Clearly marked "FIRE WATER"
- [ ] **Hose Connections:** Multiple outdoor taps with long hoses (50m+)
- [ ] **Buckets & Pumps:** Hand pumps, buckets staged at houses
- [ ] **Wet Blankets:** Keep wool blankets soaked in water storage

##### 4. Fire-Resistant Landscaping Around Houses
**Recommended Plant Species (Within 30 feet of houses):**

| Layer | Species | Fire Resistance | Water Content |
|-------|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Trees** | Pomegranate (Anar) | High | High (succulent leaves) |
| | Curry Leaf (Kadi Patta) | High | High (aromatic oils non-flammable) |

  - Use living mulch or composted mulch (not dry straw)
  - Keep mulch moist, especially in dry season
  - Remove excessive dry mulch buildup near houses
- ✅ **Plant selection:** Leafy greens, vegetables (high water content)
- ✅ **Clear pathways:** Maintain 4-foot clear paths between beds
- ✅ **Remove dry material:** Weekly cleanup of dead leaves, spent plants

---

### ZONE 2: FOOD FOREST & ANIMAL INTEGRATION

#### Fire Mitigation Role
- **Multi-layered canopy** creates shade and moisture retention
- **Central pond** acts as water source and firebreak
- **Animal grazing** reduces dry grass fuel load

#### Strategies

##### 1. Pond as Firebreak & Water Source
- [ ] **Central pond location** = strategic fire barrier
- [ ] **Fire access:** Create clear access paths to pond for water pumping
- [ ] **Water pumps:** Stage portable pump and hoses at pond
- [ ] **Pond capacity:** Maintain at least 20,000-30,000 liters for emergencies

##### 2. Vegetation Management
- [ ] **Canopy trees:** Select moisture-rich species:
  - **Mango** (thick, waxy leaves - fire resistant)
  - **Jamun** (dense canopy, high moisture)
  - **Guava** (moderate resistance)
  - **Jackfruit** (very fire resistant - thick leaves)
  - **Custard Apple** (moderate)
- [ ] **Understory:** Keep cleared of dry brush
  - Remove dead branches and leaf litter regularly
  - Allow animal grazing to control grass

- **Annual crops** = dry fuel load after harvest
- **Wheat/millet stubble** = highly flammable (April-May)
- **35-foot width** = vulnerable strip between zones 2 & 4

#### Critical Fire Mitigation Strategies

##### 1. Firebreak System
```
Zone 3 Firebreak Layout:

SWALE 2 (North boundary) ─────────────────────────
     │ 
     │ [5ft] Cleared strip (no vegetation)
     │
     ├─ Fruit Tree Row (fire-resistant species)
     │     • Pomegranate, Fig, Guava
     │     • 10-15 ft spacing
     │     • Keep understory clear
     │
     ├─ [8ft] Cleared firebreak strip ★
     │
     ├─ Annual Crop Area
     │     • Wheat, millets, vegetables
     │     • CRITICAL: Remove stubble immediately post-harvest
     │     • NO stubble burning (compost instead)
     │
     ├─ [8ft] Cleared firebreak strip ★
     │
     ├─ Biomass/Fodder Row
     │     • Nitrogen-fixers (Subabul, Gliricidia)
     │     • Regular pruning (chop-and-drop)
     │     • Keep green year-round (irrigate if needed)
     │
     │ [5ft] Cleared strip
     │
SWALE 3 (South boundary) ─────────────────────────

★ Firebreaks: Bare soil, gravel, or mowed grass (<2 inches)
```

##### 2. Crop Residue Management (CRITICAL)
- [ ] **NO STUBBLE BURNING** (zero tolerance policy)
- [ ] **Immediate residue removal** post-harvest:
  - **Option 1:** Chop and incorporate into soil
  - **Option 2:** Collect and compost in Zone 3 compost area
  - **Option 3:** Use as animal fodder (dry wheat straw)
  - **Option 4:** Mulch for Zone 1-2 gardens
- [ ] **Timeline:** Remove within 1 week of harvest
- [ ] **Never leave dry stubble** standing in field

##### 3. Fire-Resistant Crop Selection
**Lower Risk Crops (retain moisture):**
- ✅ Vegetables (irrigated regularly)
- ✅ Green fodder crops (always harvested green)
- ✅ Legumes (removed before complete drying)

**Higher Risk Crops (dry standing stubble):**
- ⚠️ Wheat (harvest and remove immediately)
- ⚠️ Millets (harvest and remove immediately)
- ⚠️ Mustard (oily seeds - extra caution)

**Strategy:** Rotate high-risk and low-risk crops seasonally
- Spring/Summer (dry season): Irrigated vegetables, green fodder
- Monsoon/Winter: Grain crops (harvest before dry season peak)

##### 4. Irrigation as Fire Prevention
- [ ] **Drip irrigation** for fruit trees (maintain moisture year-round)
- [ ] **Flood irrigation** for annual crops during growing season
- [ ] **Pre-fire watering:** Wet down Zone 3 when fire threat is high
  - Neighboring fields on fire? Immediately wet your crops
- [ ] **Swale 2 & 3:** Keep filled during dry season for emergency water

##### 5. Water Access Points
- [ ] **Swale 2:** Install permanent pump access point
- [ ] **Swale 3:** Install permanent pump access point
- [ ] **Compost area:** Keep compost moist (reduces fire risk)
- [ ] **Portable pump:** Stage diesel/electric pump with hoses

- **Tertiary Route:** West exit (perpendicular to fire)

**4. What to Bring (60 seconds)**
- People (priority #1)
- Phones, wallet, IDs
- Medications
- Water bottles
- Nothing else (DO NOT delay for possessions)

**5. Transportation**
- Load all families into available vehicles

- Invest heavily in southern firebreaks (Zones 4 & 5)
- Maintain religiously during dry season

**2. PLANT SELECTION MATTERS**
- Choose fire-resistant species: Neem, Jamun, Mango, Peepal
- Avoid flammable species: Eucalyptus, Bamboo, Lantana
- Replace existing flammable vegetation systematically

**3. WATER IS YOUR BEST DEFENSE**
- Maintain maximum water storage during dry season
- Multiple water sources provide redundancy
- Test pumps and hoses before fire season

**4. COMMUNITY COORDINATION MULTIPLIES SAFETY**
- Work with neighbors on fire prevention
- Shared equipment and knowledge
- Mutual aid during fire events

**5. PREPARATION > REACTION**
- February preparation determines March-June safety
- Regular drills build confidence and capability
