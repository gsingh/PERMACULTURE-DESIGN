## 4. CLIMATE-RESPONSIVE FEATURES

### Passive Cooling (Summer: 35-45°C)

**Design Strategies:**

**1. Orientation & Shading:**
- [ ] East-facing windows: Morning sun only
- [ ] West-facing veranda: Blocks afternoon sun
- [ ] 3-4 foot roof overhang: Prevents direct sun on walls
- [ ] Deciduous trees on south/west: Summer shade, winter sun

**2. Natural Ventilation:**
- [ ] **Cross-ventilation**: Windows on opposite walls
- [ ] **Stack effect**: High vents near ceiling (hot air escapes)
- [ ] **Night ventilation**: Open windows at night (cool thermal mass)
- [ ] **Courtyard effect**: Veranda creates air movement zone

**3. Thermal Mass:**
- [ ] Adobe/earth walls: Absorb heat during day, release at night
- [ ] 12-inch wall thickness: Delays heat transfer by 8-10 hours
- [ ] Stone flooring: Stays cool naturally

**4. Evaporative Cooling:**
- [ ] Clay water pots (traditional surahi): Natural cooling
- [ ] Wet bamboo curtains on veranda (summer months)
- [ ] Small water feature near entrance: Cools incoming air

**5. Reflective Surfaces:**
- [ ] White/light-colored lime plaster: Reflects solar radiation
- [ ] Light-colored roof tiles
- [ ] Reflective roof coating (optional)

**Expected Results:**
- Indoor temperature: 4-7°C cooler than outside
- Comfortable even in 40°C+ heat with ceiling fan
- Minimal/no air conditioning needed

---

### Monsoon Protection (July-September)

**Water Management:**

**1. Roof Design:**
- [ ] Steep pitch (30-40 degrees): Rapid water runoff
- [ ] Large overhang: Protects walls from rain
- [ ] No flat areas: Prevents water pooling

  - Monsoon rainfall: 50-60 inches in 3 months
  - Collection potential: ~15,000 liters/season
  - Stored water: Supplements guest room needs year-round
- [ ] Overflow to swale/pond system
- [ ] First-flush diverter: Prevents contamination
- [ ] Cost: ₹20,000-30,000

**3. Drainage:**
- [ ] Grade slopes away from structure (2% minimum)
- [ ] French drains around foundation
- [ ] Greywater to banana circle (50 feet from structure)
- [ ] No water accumulation near building

**4. Moisture Protection:**
- [ ] Raised plinth: Above monsoon water level
- [ ] Damp-proof course: Below wall level
- [ ] Lime plaster: Breathable, prevents moisture buildup
