# Swale Design & Tree Plantation Plan
## UPDATED FOR 4-FAMILY CLUSTER VILLAGE LAYOUT
## Site: 4 Acre x 1 Acre Land

---

## 🏘️ CRITICAL UPDATE: Integration with Cluster Housing

This document has been **REVISED** to integrate swale placement with the **Cluster Village (Option 1)** four-family housing layout. The housing cluster occupies the northern portion of the property, requiring strategic swale placement adjustments.

### **Key Integration Points:**
1. **Housing Zone** (northern 60-80 feet): 4 houses + common house + children's area
2. **Zone 1 Gardens** (private strips): Immediately south of houses
3. **Shared Zone 1** (communal gardens): South of private strips
4. **Swale System**: Begins south of intensive gardens, protects housing from runoff
5. **Pond Location**: Southeast corner (unchanged, actually enhanced by housing placement)

---

## 1. SITE ANALYSIS (REVISED)

### Land Dimensions
- **Total Area**: 4 acres (approximately 174,240 sq ft or 16,187 sq m)
- **Dimensions**: 4 acres (length) x 1 acre (width)
  - Length (E-W): ~836 feet / 255 meters
  - Width (N-S): ~209 feet / 64 meters
- **Orientation**: Long axis runs East-West
- **Topography**: Mainly plain with slight gradient from North to South
- **Slope Direction**: North to South (downslope)

### Key Design Considerations (UPDATED FOR CLUSTER HOUSING)
1. Water flows from North to South due to gradient
2. **Housing cluster occupies northern 60-80 feet** (Zone 0 + immediate Zone 1)
3. Swales run perpendicular to slope (East-West direction) **STARTING SOUTH OF HOUSING**
4. **First swale positioned to capture runoff from housing/garden area**
5. Swales protect gardens and prevent water logging near houses
6. Pond placement (SE corner) receives water from swale system + benefits from housing microclimate

---

## 2. SWALE DESIGN PRINCIPLES

### What are Swales?
- Level ditches dug along contour lines (perpendicular to water flow)
- Capture and infiltrate rainwater runoff
- Prevent soil erosion
- Recharge groundwater
- Create microclimates for tree establishment

### Design Parameters for Your Site

#### Swale Dimensions (Recommended)
- **Width**: 3-4 feet (0.9-1.2 m) at top
- **Depth**: 1.5-2 feet (0.45-0.6 m)
- **Length**: ~830 feet (253 m) - nearly full E-W length
- **Spacing**: 40-60 feet (12-18 m) apart (depends on slope angle)
- **Berm height**: 1-1.5 feet (0.3-0.45 m) on downslope side

#### Recommended Number of Swales
Given your 209-foot width (N-S) and recommended spacing:
- **4-5 swales** across the property
- Spacing: approximately 50 feet apart

### Detailed Swale Specifications (INTEGRATED WITH HOUSING)

#### Swale 1 (Critical for Housing Protection)
- **Location**: 110 feet from north boundary (immediately south of Shared Zone 1)
- **Purpose**: 
  - **PRIMARY**: Captures runoff from housing cluster, roofs, paved areas
  - Protects Zone 1 gardens from waterlogging
  - Creates moisture zone for young food forest
  - First major infiltration point
- **Special considerations**: 
  - Slightly wider (4 ft) and deeper (2 ft) to handle concentrated housing runoff
  - Multiple inlet points from greywater gardens (Zone 1)
  - Overflow to Swale 2 during heavy monsoon
- **Trees**: Pioneer nitrogen fixers (Gliricidia, Subabul) for rapid soil building
- **Access**: Maintain clear path for all 4 families to reach this swale

#### Swale 2 (Transition to Food Forest)
- **Location**: 160 feet from north boundary
- **Purpose**: 
  - Secondary water capture for Zone 2 food forest
  - **Inlet channel to pond begins here** (SE direction)
  - Creates moisture for establishing fruit trees
- **Special considerations**:
  - Spillway every 150 feet for overflow management
  - Connection point for pond inlet channel (rock-lined, vegetated)
- **Trees**: Mix of fruit trees (mango, jamun, guava) + nitrogen fixers
- **Community function**: Families can harvest fruit along entire swale length

#### Swale 3 (Deep Infiltration & Pond Feed)
- **Location**: 195 feet from north boundary
- **Purpose**: 
  - Deep water infiltration for Zone 3 production
  - **Main pond inlet channel** (most water flows here to pond)
  - Supports mature food forest and annual crop areas
- **Special considerations**:
  - Larger spillway structures (manages heavy water flow to pond)
  - Main inlet channel well-designed (2-3 ft wide, rock-lined)
- **Trees**: Large canopy species, timber trees, bamboo clusters
- **Production focus**: Lower maintenance perennials, biomass production

### KEY CHANGES FROM ORIGINAL PLAN:

**What Changed:**
- ❌ **Removed**: Swale at 35 ft (would interfere with housing)
- ❌ **Removed**: Swale at 85 ft (too close to private Zone 1 gardens)
- ✅ **Added**: First swale at 110 ft (perfect placement after gardens)
- ✅ **Added**: Reduced from 4 swales to 3 swales (adequate for remaining space)
- ✅ **Enhanced**: Pond integration stronger with 3 well-spaced swales

**Why This Works Better:**
1. **Housing protected**: No water pooling near houses or gardens
2. **Zone 1 usable**: Intensive gardens not interrupted by swales
3. **Better spacing**: 50 ft between swales (ideal for tree growth and access)
4. **Simpler maintenance**: Fewer swales, clearer community responsibility zones
5. **Enhanced water flow**: Concentrated flow to pond more efficient

---

## 4. COMMUNITY BENEFITS & RESPONSIBILITIES

### How Swales Benefit the 4-Family Cluster

#### Direct Benefits to Housing Cluster:
1. **Flood Protection**: Swales prevent runoff from flowing back toward houses during heavy monsoon
2. **Greywater Management**: Zone 1 greywater can flow naturally toward Swale 1 (gravity-fed irrigation)
3. **Microclimate Cooling**: Trees along swales create cooler air that drifts north toward housing
4. **Food Production Access**: All families equidistant from swale tree lines (200-300 meters round trip)
5. **Children's Education**: Swales become outdoor classroom for observing water cycles, tree growth
6. **Community Gathering**: Swale berms = comfortable seating areas for evening socializing

#### Shared Responsibilities (Community Agreement Needed):

**Swale 1 Maintenance (Closest to Housing):**
- **Primary responsibility**: All 4 families (most benefit)
- **Tasks**: 
  - Quarterly: Check for erosion, debris removal
  - Annually: Prune trees for chop-and-drop mulch (distribute to Zone 1 gardens)
  - Post-monsoon: Clear spillways, check infiltration
- **Labor**: Rotate monthly among families (4-6 hours/quarter)

**Swale 2 Maintenance:**
- **Primary responsibility**: Families 1 & 2 (nearest location)
- **Tasks**: 
  - Tree harvesting (fruit belongs to maintainers)
  - Inlet channel to pond maintenance
  - Spillway management
- **Labor**: 6-8 hours/quarter
- **Benefit**: First access to fruit from these trees

**Swale 3 Maintenance:**
- **Primary responsibility**: Families 3 & 4 (nearest to SE pond)
- **Tasks**:
  - Main pond inlet management (critical!)
  - Mature tree maintenance
  - Timber/bamboo harvesting coordination
- **Labor**: 6-8 hours/quarter
- **Benefit**: Proximity to pond for irrigation, duck access

**Shared Harvest Protocol:**
- **Nitrogen fixers (all swales)**: Biomass belongs to community (shared composting)
- **Fruit trees**: 
  - 50% to maintaining family
  - 50% shared among all families
- **Timber/bamboo**: Community decision (consensus required for harvest)

### Integration with Housing Infrastructure

#### Greywater from Houses → Swale 1:
```
Individual Houses (4x)
    ↓ Kitchen & Bath greywater
    → Mulch basin filters (Zone 1 private strips)
    → Overflow channels
    ↓
Shared Zone 1 Gardens
    → Use excess greywater
    ↓
★ SWALE 1 ★
    → Final infiltration + tree irrigation
    → Overflow to Swale 2 if needed
```

#### Rainwater from Roofs:
- **Option A (Recommended)**: Harvest to shared cistern, use for drinking/cooking
- **Option B**: Overflow from full cisterns → directed to Swale 1 via channels
- **Calculation**: 4 houses + common house roofs = ~5,000 sq ft
  - Per inch of rain: ~3,000 gallons captured
  - Annual potential (30 in): ~90,000 gallons
  - Storage needed: 10,000-20,000 gallon cistern

#### Access Paths Through Swale System:
```
Houses → Daily Path → Private Zone 1 → Shared Zone 1
                                            ↓
                            Cross Swale 1 (stepping stones/bridge)
                                            ↓
                            Zone 2 Food Forest (daily animal care)
                                            ↓
                            Cross Swale 2 (stepping stones)
                                            ↓
                            Zone 3 (weekly access)
                                            ↓
                            Cross Swale 3 (path to pond)
                                            ↓
                            Pond (duck care, irrigation, recreation)
```

**Path Design:**
- Width: 4-6 feet (wheelbarrow/cart accessible)
- Material: Mulched path, gravel in muddy sections
- Swale crossings: Simple wooden bridges (8-10 ft) or stepping stones
- Maintenance: Community responsibility (rotate quarterly)

---

## 4. TREE PLANTATION STRATEGY (COMMUNITY APPROACH)

### Planting Zones Along Each Swale

#### Zone A: On the Berm (Downslope side)
- **Best location** - trees benefit from water infiltrating from swale
- **Spacing**: 15-20 feet apart
- **Trees per swale**: ~40-50 trees
- **Total for 4 swales**: ~160-200 trees

#### Zone B: Swale Banks (Both sides)
- Additional planting on swale edges
- **Spacing**: 10-15 feet for smaller species
- **Purpose**: Stabilization, edge effect

#### Zone C: Between Swales
- Scattered planting for orchard/forest garden
- **Spacing**: 20-30 feet
- **Purpose**: Production, biodiversity

### Tree Species Recommendations

#### Tier 1: Canopy Trees (On Berms)
**Pioneer/Nitrogen Fixers** (plant first for soil building):
- Gliricidia (30-40% of trees)
- Subabul/Leucaena
- Sesbania
- Acacia species

**Fruit Trees** (after soil establishment):
- Mango (hardy varieties)
- Jamun
- Jackfruit
- Guava
- Custard Apple
- Tamarind (drought tolerant)

**Timber/Multi-purpose**:
- Neem (pest control, medicinal)
- Bamboo clusters (at intervals)
- Drumstick/Moringa
- Pongamia (biodiesel, nitrogen fixer)

#### Tier 2: Mid-Story Trees
- Papaya (quick production)
- Banana (water indicators)
- Curry Leaf
- Lemon/Lime
- Pomegranate

#### Tier 3: Understory & Ground Cover
- Pigeon Pea
- Turmeric
- Ginger
- Sweet Potato
- Pumpkin/Gourd vines

### Planting Pattern (Guild Approach)

For each 60-foot section along a swale:

```
Pattern Unit (repeat along swale):
─────────────────────────────────────
1. Nitrogen Fixer (Gliricidia) - 0 ft
2. Fruit Tree (Mango) - 20 ft
3. Multi-purpose (Neem) - 40 ft
4. Nitrogen Fixer (Subabul) - 60 ft
─────────────────────────────────────
```

**Between swales**: Intersperse with mid-story and understory

## 5. WATER MANAGEMENT CALCULATIONS

### Water Harvesting Potential

#### Per Swale Capacity
- Length: 830 feet (253 m)
- Width: 3.5 feet average (1.1 m)
- Depth: 1.75 feet (0.53 m)
- **Volume per swale**: ~5,100 cubic feet (144 cubic meters)
- **Gallons per swale**: ~38,000 gallons (144,000 liters)

#### Total System Capacity
- **4 swales**: ~152,000 gallons (576,000 liters)
- This equals approximately **3.5 inches of rainfall** across your 4-acre site

### Annual Rainfall Benefit
Assuming 30 inches annual rainfall:
- **Without swales**: Most runoff lost
- **With swales**: 10-15% retained and infiltrated
- **Additional water available**: ~1.3 million gallons/year infiltrated

---

## 6. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### Phase 1: Site Preparation (Weeks 1-2)

#### Week 1: Survey & Marking
- [ ] Professional survey to mark exact contour lines
- [ ] Use A-frame level or laser level for precision
- [ ] Mark swale centerlines with stakes and string
- [ ] Mark tree planting positions

#### Week 2: Access Planning
- [ ] Identify equipment access routes
- [ ] Plan material storage areas
- [ ] Arrange water supply for post-construction
- [ ] Procure mulch materials

### Phase 2: Earthworks (Weeks 3-5)

#### Equipment Needed
- Small excavator or tractor with box blade
- Dump truck (if offsite spoil disposal needed)
- Compaction equipment for berms

#### Construction Sequence
1. **Start from upslope (north)** and work downward
2. Excavate first swale
3. Form berm on downslope side with excavated soil
4. Compact berm to prevent erosion
5. Repeat for remaining swales
6. Create spillways every 150-200 feet for overflow

#### Quality Checks
- Verify swales are level (no ponding at ends)
- Check berm stability
- Ensure smooth transitions at ends
- Test water flow with hose during construction

### Phase 3: Soil Amendment (Week 6)

- [ ] Test soil in swales and berms
- [ ] Add compost/organic matter to planting areas
- [ ] Create biochar if available
- [ ] Prepare planting holes on berms (2x2x2 feet)
- [ ] Mix soil amendments in planting holes

### Phase 4: Tree Planting (Weeks 7-9)

#### Timing
- **Best time**: Beginning of monsoon season
- **Alternative**: Pre-monsoon with irrigation setup

#### Planting Protocol
1. Start with nitrogen fixers (Gliricidia, Subabul)
2. Plant on berms 15-20 feet apart
3. Stake tall saplings
4. Heavy mulch around each tree (4-inch layer)
5. Create small water basin around each tree
6. Water immediately after planting

#### Recommended Sizes
- Nitrogen fixers: 2-3 feet tall saplings or cuttings
- Fruit trees: 1-2 year old grafted saplings
- Fast-growers: Direct seeding possible

### Phase 5: Establishment (Months 3-12)

#### First Monsoon Season
- [ ] Monitor water flow and infiltration
- [ ] Repair any erosion damage
- [ ] Replant any failed trees (expect 5-10% mortality)
- [ ] Mulch replenishment

#### Ongoing Maintenance
- [ ] Weed management in swales (first 2 years)
- [ ] Pruning nitrogen fixers for mulch (chop & drop)
- [ ] Interplanting annuals between trees
- [ ] Monitor tree growth and health

## 7. POND INTEGRATION FOR WATER STORAGE & AQUACULTURE

### Design Rationale
Integrating a pond into your swale system creates multiple benefits:
- **Water storage** for dry season irrigation
- **Microclimate** cooling effect (3-5°C temperature reduction)
- **Aquaculture** - ducks, geese, fish production
- **Wildlife habitat** - attracts beneficial insects, birds, amphibians
- **Fire protection** - emergency water reservoir
- **Aesthetic & recreation** value
- **Overflow management** from swale system

### Recommended Pond Locations (Choose One)

#### Option 1: Southeast Corner (RECOMMENDED)
**Rationale:**
- Lowest point of property (receives gravity-fed water from all swales)
- Morning sun exposure (East-facing, ideal for ducks/geese)
- Away from dwelling (noise/smell management)
- Creates productive zone in underutilized corner
- Easy overflow to exit property boundary

**Specifications:**
- **Location**: Southeast corner, ~750-800 feet from west boundary, ~20-30 feet from south boundary
- **Size**: 50 feet x 40 feet (2,000 sq ft / 0.046 acres)
- **Depth**: 6-8 feet at deepest point (stepped design)
- **Volume**: ~8,000-10,000 gallons (30,000-38,000 liters)

#### Option 2: Central Location (Between Swales 2 & 3)
**Rationale:**
- Accessible from all parts of property
- Can feed water both upslope and downslope as needed
- Maximum microclimate benefit across entire site
- Central hub for farm activities

**Specifications:**
- **Location**: Center of property, ~400 feet from west boundary
- **Size**: 40 feet x 35 feet (1,400 sq ft)
- **Depth**: 5-7 feet at deepest
- **Volume**: ~6,000-8,000 gallons

#### Option 3: Multiple Small Ponds
**Rationale:**
- Distributed microclimate benefits
- Risk mitigation (if one fails)
- Each connected to specific swale

**Specifications:**
- **Number**: 2-3 ponds
- **Size**: 25-30 feet diameter each
- **Connected**: To swales 1, 2, and 4
- **Total storage**: Similar to Option 1

    ◄────── 50 feet ──────►
```

#### Zoning Design

**Zone 1: Shallow Shelf (1-2 feet depth)**
- **Width**: 6-8 feet around perimeter
- **Purpose**: 
  - Duck/geese wading and feeding area
  - Aquatic plant zone (water purification)
  - Easy wildlife access
- **Plants**: Water chestnuts, lotus, taro, watercress

**Zone 2: Intermediate (3-5 feet depth)**
- **Purpose**: Main waterfowl swimming area
- **Plants**: Submerged oxygenators, lily pads

**Zone 3: Deep Zone (6-8 feet depth)**
- **Purpose**: 
  - Fish habitat (if desired)
  - Temperature regulation
  - Silt collection
  - Winter refuge for aquatic life
- **Location**: Center of pond, ~20-30% of total area

### Integration with Swale System

#### Water Collection System

**From Swale 4 (Primary Source):**
```
Swale 4 (@ 185ft from north)
    │
    ├─── Main Inlet Channel (gentle grade, 1-2%)
    │    ├─ Width: 2-3 feet
    │    ├─ Length: ~600 feet
    │    ├─ Rock-lined for erosion control
    │    └─ Vegetated banks (vetiver, lemongrass)
    │
    └──► POND (Southeast corner)
         │
         └──► Overflow to property boundary or
              ╰──► Return channel to lower swale sections
```

**From Swale 3 (Secondary Source):**
- Emergency overflow during heavy rains
- Shorter connection channel (~500 feet)
- Can be simple grass swale

#### Water Distribution FROM Pond

**Irrigation System:**
- Gravity-fed drip lines to nearby growing areas
- Simple siphon system (no pump needed)
- Can water areas within 100-150 feet radius

**Overflow Management:**
- Primary: To property boundary (south/east)
- Secondary: Back to lower sections of swales
- Monk pipe or spillway design for controlled release

### Pond Construction Details

#### Excavation Specifications
- **Total excavation**: ~600-800 cubic yards
- **Spoil use**: 
  - Build berm on north/west side (3-4 feet high)
  - Creates windbreak and temperature buffer
  - Increases effective depth
  - Create mounds for fruit trees around pond

#### Sealing Options

**Option A: Clay Lining (Most Natural)**
- 6-8 inch compacted clay layer
