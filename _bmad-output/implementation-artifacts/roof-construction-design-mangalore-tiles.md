```

**Roof Dimensions:**

**Slope Length (Rafter Run):**
- Half span (from wall to ridge): 15 ft (horizontal)
- At 30° slope: Rafter length = 15 ft ÷ cos(30°) = 17.32 ft
- Add overhang: 17.32 ft + 3 ft = **20.32 ft per rafter** (north and south sides)

**Ridge Height:**
- Wall height: 10 ft (typical)
- Ridge height above wall: 15 ft × tan(30°) = 8.66 ft
- **Total ridge height:** 10 ft + 8.66 ft = **18.66 ft** (19 ft from ground to ridge peak)

**Roof Area:**
- North slope: 28 ft (length) × 20.32 ft (rafter) = 569 sq ft
- South slope: 28 ft × 20.32 ft = 569 sq ft
- **Total roof area:** 1,138 sq ft (includes overhangs)
- **Roof area WITHOUT overhangs:** ~970 sq ft

**Gable Ends (East & West):**
- Triangular area: 30 ft (base) × 8.66 ft (height) ÷ 2 = 130 sq ft each
- Total gable area: 260 sq ft

## 🔨 ROOF STRUCTURAL SYSTEM

### Option A: Timber Truss System (TRADITIONAL, RECOMMENDED)

**Why Timber:**
- ✅ Traditional construction method in India
- ✅ Renewable material (sustainably sourced)
- ✅ Good thermal insulation (wood is natural insulator)
- ✅ Easy to work with (standard carpentry tools)
- ✅ Accepts nails/screws easily (panel mounting)
- ✅ Cost-effective (₹2,94,000-3,80,000 per house)

**Disadvantages:**
- ⚠️ Requires termite treatment (critical in Haryana)
- ⚠️ Fire risk (requires fire-retardant treatment)
- ⚠️ Can warp/twist if not properly dried (use kiln-dried lumber)

---

#### Timber Species Selection

**Primary Options (Structural Strength):**

**Option 1: Teak (सागौन - Sagaun)** ⭐ BEST but EXPENSIVE
- **Strength:** Excellent (compressive strength: 600-700 kg/cm²)
- **Durability:** Natural termite resistance (high silica content)
- **Moisture:** Low moisture absorption (doesn't warp easily)
- **Lifespan:** 50-100+ years (even without treatment)
- **Cost:** ₹3,000-5,000 per cubic foot
- **Availability:** Limited (plantation teak available, but expensive)
- **Use:** Ridge beam, main rafters (high-stress members)

**Option 2: Sal (साल - Saal)** ⭐ GOOD BALANCE
- **Strength:** Very good (compressive strength: 550-650 kg/cm²)
- **Durability:** Good termite resistance (natural resins)
- **Moisture:** Moderate absorption (requires drying)
- **Lifespan:** 40-60 years (with basic treatment)
- **Cost:** ₹1,500-2,500 per cubic foot
- **Availability:** Good (Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh forests)
- **Use:** All structural members (rafters, purlins, ridge beam)

**Option 3: Mango Wood (आम - Aam)** ⭐ BUDGET-FRIENDLY
- **Strength:** Moderate-good (compressive strength: 450-550 kg/cm²)
- **Durability:** Low (MUST treat for termites)
- **Moisture:** High absorption (requires thorough drying + treatment)
- **Lifespan:** 20-40 years (with proper treatment)
- **Cost:** ₹800-1,500 per cubic foot
- **Availability:** Excellent (local orchards, tree removal services)
- **Use:** Purlins, battens (non-critical members); OK for rafters if treated

**Option 4: Eucalyptus (नीलगिरी - Neelgiri)** - AVOID for main structure
- **Strength:** Moderate (400-500 kg/cm²)
- **Durability:** Low (high shrinkage, warping)
- **Moisture:** Very high absorption (twists and cracks)
- **Lifespan:** 15-25 years
- **Cost:** ₹600-1,000 per cubic foot
- **Availability:** Excellent (fast-growing plantations)
- **Use:** ONLY for temporary scaffolding or purlins (NOT rafters or ridge beam)

**RECOMMENDED for Your Project:**
- **Ridge beam:** Sal or Teak (₹40,000-80,000 for all 4 houses)
- **Rafters:** Sal (₹80,000-1,20,000 for all 4 houses)
- **Purlins:** Mango or Sal (₹40,000-60,000 for all 4 houses)
- **Battens:** Mango (₹20,000-30,000 for all 4 houses)

---

#### Timber Sizing (Structural Members)

**1. Ridge Beam (Peak of Roof):**

**Purpose:** Supports top of all rafters, carries concentrated load

**Size:** 6 inches × 8 inches (150mm × 200mm)

**Length:** 28 ft (full house length) + 1 ft overhang each end = **30 ft per house**

**Quantity:** 1 beam per house × 4 houses = **4 beams**

**Connection:** Sits on gable end walls (load-bearing walls on east/west)

**Material:** Sal or Teak (NO substitutions - this is critical member)

**Cost per House:**
- Sal: 30 ft × 4 sq ft (cross-section) = 120 board ft × ₹1,800/bf = ₹2,16,000 ÷ 4 houses = **₹54,000 per house**
- Teak: ₹90,000-1,20,000 per house (if available and budget allows)

---

**2. Rafters (Main Sloping Members):**

**Purpose:** Support roof covering (tiles), transfer load to walls and ridge

**Size:** 3 inches × 6 inches (75mm × 150mm)

**Spacing:** 18-24 inches on center (OC)
- 18 inches OC: More rafters, stronger (recommended for solar panels)
- 24 inches OC: Fewer rafters, adequate for tiles only

**Quantity Calculation (18-inch spacing):**
- House length: 28 ft
- Number of rafters: (28 ft ÷ 1.5 ft) + 1 = **19 rafters per side**
- Total rafters: 19 × 2 sides = **38 rafters per house**

**Length per Rafter:** 20.5 ft (17.32 ft slope + 3 ft overhang)

**Total Rafter Length:** 38 rafters × 20.5 ft = **779 linear feet** per house

**Cross-section:** 3 in × 6 in = 1.5 sq ft

**Volume:** 779 ft × 1.5 sq ft = **1,168.5 board feet** per house

**Material:** Sal (good strength-to-cost ratio)

**Cost per House:**
- Sal: 1,168.5 bf × ₹1,800/bf = **₹2,10,330** ÷ 10 (board foot conversion) = **₹21,033 per house**

Wait, let me recalculate correctly:

**Board Feet Calculation:**
- 1 board foot = 1 ft × 1 ft × 1 inch thickness
- 3 inches × 6 inches × 779 ft = (3×6÷144) × 779 = 97.375 board feet per rafter
- Wait, that's wrong too. Let me use proper formula:

**Board Feet = (Width in inches × Height in inches × Length in feet) ÷ 12**

- Per rafter: (3 in × 6 in × 20.5 ft) ÷ 12 = 30.75 board feet
- Total: 38 rafters × 30.75 bf = **1,168.5 board feet** per house ✓ (this is correct)

**Cost per House:**
- Sal: 1,168.5 bf × ₹20/bf (₹1,800/cubic foot ÷ 90 board feet per cubic foot) = **₹23,370 per house**

Let me simplify: **₹25,000-35,000 per house for all rafters** (Sal)

---

**3. Purlins (Horizontal Members Between Rafters):**

**Purpose:** Support roof battens, provide lateral bracing for rafters

**Size:** 2 inches × 4 inches (50mm × 100mm)

**Spacing:** 18-24 inches vertically (up slope direction)
- For 17.32 ft rafter run, with 2 ft spacing: **9 purlins per side**

**Quantity:** 9 purlins per side × 2 sides × 28 ft length = **504 linear feet** per house

**Material:** Mango or Sal

**Cost per House:**
- Mango: 504 linear feet × 2/3 sq ft (cross-section) = 336 board feet × ₹10/bf = **₹3,360 per house**
- Sal: **₹5,000-7,000 per house**

---

**4. Roof Battens (Support Mangalore Tiles):**

**Purpose:** Tiles rest on battens, battens nail to purlins

**Size:** 1 inch × 2 inches (25mm × 50mm) OR 1.5 inches × 2 inches

**Spacing:** 10-12 inches (matches tile overlap)
- Mangalore tile length: ~14 inches
- Overlap: ~4 inches
- Exposed length: ~10 inches
- **Batten spacing: 10 inches on center**

**Quantity:** 
- Rafter length: 20.5 ft = 246 inches
- Number of battens: 246 ÷ 10 = **25 battens per rafter**
- Total battens: 25 × 38 rafters = **950 battens per house**
- Total length: 950 battens × 28 ft (house length) = **26,600 linear feet** per house

Wait, that's excessive. Let me recalculate:

Actually, battens run PERPENDICULAR to rafters (along house length):
- Number of batten rows up the slope: 17.32 ft × 12 inches ÷ 10 inch spacing = **21 batten rows**
- Length of each batten: 28 ft (house length) + 2 ft overhangs = 30 ft
- Total batten length: 21 rows × 30 ft × 2 sides = **1,260 linear feet** per house

**Material:** Mango (cheapest, adequate for battens)

**Cost per House:**
- Mango: 1,260 ft × 1/6 sq ft (1"×2" cross-section) = 210 board feet × ₹10/bf = **₹2,100 per house**

#### Timber Treatment (CRITICAL)

**Termite Treatment (MANDATORY):**

**Method 1: Borax Treatment (DIY, Eco-Friendly)** ⭐ RECOMMENDED
- **Solution:** Borax (sodium borate) powder dissolved in water
- **Ratio:** 1 kg borax : 5 liters water
- **Application:**
  - Soak small pieces: Submerge in solution 24-48 hours
  - Brush large pieces: Apply 3-4 coats (let dry between coats)
  - Focus on ends and joints (termite entry points)
- **Cost:** ₹500-1,000 per house (borax is cheap)
- **Lifespan:** 15-20 years (renew by spraying every 10 years)
- **Safety:** Non-toxic to humans/pets when dry

**Method 2: Creosote Oil (Industrial, Toxic)**
- Professional treatment (timber supplier usually offers)
- Very effective (30+ year protection)
- TOXIC (not eco-friendly, not suitable for permaculture farm)
- Cost: ₹50-100 extra per board foot
- **NOT RECOMMENDED for your project**

**Method 3: Neem Oil Treatment (Natural, Moderate Effectiveness)**
- **Solution:** Pure neem oil OR neem oil + borax (stronger)
- **Application:** Brush on all surfaces, 2-3 coats
- **Cost:** ₹2,000-4,000 per house (neem oil expensive)
- **Lifespan:** 5-10 years (shorter than borax)
- **Use:** Supplement to borax (apply both for maximum protection)

**Fire Treatment (RECOMMENDED):**

**Method: Ammonium Phosphate Solution**
- **Solution:** 1 kg ammonium phosphate : 5 liters water
- **Application:** Spray or brush 2-3 coats on all surfaces
- **Effect:** Reduces flame spread, increases ignition temperature
- **Cost:** ₹1,000-2,000 per house
- **Building code:** May be required (check with Kurukshetra building dept)

**Total Treatment Cost per House:** ₹1,500-4,000 (borax + fire treatment)

---

### Option B: Steel Truss System (MODERN, LOW-MAINTENANCE)

**Why Steel:**
- ✅ Termite-proof (no biological deterioration)
- ✅ Fire-resistant (doesn't burn, but weakens at high temp)
- ✅ No warping or twisting (dimensionally stable)
- ✅ Longer lifespan (50-100 years with minimal maintenance)
- ✅ Thinner members (more interior space)

**Disadvantages:**
- ⚠️ Higher upfront cost (₹3,20,000-4,20,000 per house)
- ⚠️ Requires welding (skilled labor needed)
- ⚠️ Conducts heat (can make attic hotter - mitigate with insulation)
- ⚠️ Rust risk (requires paint/galvanizing in monsoon climate)

---

#### Steel Member Sizing

**1. Ridge Beam:**
- **Size:** 100mm × 100mm × 3mm box section OR 100mm C-channel
- **Length:** 30 ft per house
- **Material:** Mild steel (MS) OR galvanized iron (GI - better for Kurukshetra)
- **Cost:** ₹8,000-12,000 per house (GI)

**2. Rafters:**
- **Size:** 75mm × 50mm × 2.5mm C-channel
- **Spacing:** 24 inches on center (steel is stronger, can space wider)
- **Quantity:** (28 ft ÷ 2 ft) + 1 = 15 rafters per side = 30 total
- **Length:** 20.5 ft per rafter
- **Cost:** ₹30,000-45,000 per house (MS), ₹45,000-60,000 (GI)

**3. Purlins:**
- **Size:** 50mm × 50mm × 2mm angle iron OR 50mm C-channel
- **Spacing:** 2 ft vertically
- **Quantity:** 9 purlins per side × 2 sides × 30 ft = 540 linear feet
- **Cost:** ₹15,000-20,000 per house

**4. Battens (for tile support):**
- **Still use wood:** Steel battens are overkill and expensive
- **Size:** 1" × 2" mango wood
- **Cost:** ₹2,100 per house (same as timber option)

**Total Steel Frame Cost per House:** ₹55,000-85,000 (frame only, excludes welding labor)

**Welding Labor:** ₹20,000-30,000 per house (3-5 days skilled welder)

**Rust Protection:**
- Galvanizing (factory): Included if using GI members
- OR Paint (if MS): Red oxide primer + enamel paint (₹5,000-8,000 per house)

**Total Steel Truss System:** ₹80,000-1,23,000 per house (material + labor + protection)

### Structural Load Calculations

**Dead Load (Permanent Weight):**

| Component | Weight (kg/sq m) | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| Mangalore tiles | 45-50 | Installed with mortar |
| Battens (wood) | 5-8 | 1"×2" mango, 10" spacing |
| Purlins (wood) | 8-12 | 2"×4" sal, 24" spacing |
| Rafters (wood) | 10-15 | 3"×6" sal, 18" spacing |
| Ridge beam | 15-20 | 6"×8" sal |
| Insulation (straw bale) | 10-15 | 4-inch thick layer |
| **TOTAL DEAD LOAD** | **93-120 kg/sq m** | Conservative estimate |

**Live Load (Temporary Weight):**

| Load Type | Weight (kg/sq m) | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| Solar panels + mounting | 15-18 | 9 panels distributed |
| Workers (construction/maintenance) | 50-75 | 1-2 people per 10 sq m |
| Snow (unlikely in Kurukshetra) | 0-10 | Rare, light if any |
| Wind uplift (negative load) | -50 to -100 | At 150 km/h wind speed |
| **TOTAL LIVE LOAD (max)** | **75-100 kg/sq m** | Conservative |

**Total Roof Load (Dead + Live):** 168-220 kg/sq m

**Indian Building Code (IS 875) Requirements:**
- Minimum roof design load: 75 kg/sq m (sloped roofs)
- Your roof load: 168-220 kg/sq m
- **Safety factor:** 2.2-2.9× (adequate - code requires minimum 1.5×)

**Conclusion:** Timber trusses (3"×6" rafters @ 18" OC) OR steel trusses (75mm C-channel @ 24" OC) are both ADEQUATE for:
- Mangalore tiles + insulation + solar panels + workers + wind

**HOWEVER: Professional structural engineer verification REQUIRED before construction**

### Tile Installation Method

**1. Batten Preparation:**

**Batten Spacing:**
- Tile length: 14 inches (average)
- Tile overlap: 3-4 inches (minimum 3 inches for monsoon)
- Exposed length: 10-11 inches
- **Batten spacing: 10 inches on center** (up the slope)

**Batten Leveling:**
- Use string line from eave to ridge
- Check level with spirit level every 10 feet
- **Critical:** First batten at eave must be perfectly level (sets alignment for all tiles)

**Batten Attachment:**
- Nail to purlins: 3-inch galvanized nails, 2 nails per purlin intersection
- Spacing: Batten nails 12-16 inches apart along batten length

---

**2. Tile Installation (Bottom to Top):**

**Starting Row (Eave):**
- Install first row of tiles at eave
- Tiles overhang batten by 2-3 inches (drip edge)
- Secure every 3rd or 4th tile with copper wire or nail (others held by gravity + overlap)
- **Pattern:** Alternate "pan" (trough) and "cover" (cap) tiles
  - Pan tile: Sits on batten, curved side down (collects water)
  - Cover tile: Overlaps edge of pan tiles, curved side up (sheds water)

**Subsequent Rows:**
- Each row overlaps previous by 3-4 inches
- Offset tiles by half width (staggered pattern - prevents water infiltration)
- Secure perimeter tiles and ridge tiles (high wind areas)

**Ridge Cap:**
- Special ridge tiles OR cut tiles to fit ridge angle
- Mortar ridge tiles in place (cement-sand 1:4)
- Install ridge vent under ridge tiles (see below)

**Valley Installation (if applicable):**
- Metal valley flashing under tiles (galvanized steel or copper)
- Width: 18-24 inches (12 inches up each side of valley)
- Tiles cut to fit valley edges, mortared in place

---

**3. Tile Fastening (Wind Resistance):**

**Minimum Fastening (Low Wind Area):**
- Secure every 5th tile row
- Secure all perimeter tiles (eave, rake, ridge)
- Method: Copper wire through tile holes, tied to batten

**Standard Fastening (Kurukshetra - Moderate Wind):**
- Secure every 3rd tile row
- Secure perimeter + every 4th tile along row
- Method: Copper wire or tile clips

**Hurricane/High Wind Fastening (Optional):**
- Secure EVERY tile
- Method: Foam adhesive (tile adhesive) + wire/clips
- Cost: ₹20-30 extra per tile (expensive, not necessary for Kurukshetra)

**Recommended for Your Project:**
- **Standard fastening:** Every 3rd row, perimeter + every 4th tile
- **Cost:** ₹5,000-8,000 per house (copper wire + labor)

---

### Tile Underlayment (Waterproof Membrane)

**Purpose:** Secondary waterproofing (in case tile cracks or displaces)

**Material Options:**

**Option 1: Roofing Felt (Tar Paper)** - TRADITIONAL
- **Type:** 15 lb or 30 lb asphalt-saturated felt
- **Application:** Roll out horizontally, overlap 4-6 inches, nail to battens
- **Advantages:** Cheap, easy to install, breathable
- **Disadvantages:** 10-20 year lifespan (shorter than tiles), can tear
- **Cost:** ₹15-25 per sq meter (₹1,590-2,650 per house)

**Option 2: Synthetic Underlayment (Tyvek, etc.)** - MODERN
- **Type:** Woven polyethylene OR polypropylene fabric
- **Application:** Same as felt, but lighter and stronger
- **Advantages:** 25-30 year lifespan, won't tear, UV-resistant (can be exposed months before tiling)
- **Disadvantages:** 2-3× cost of felt
- **Cost:** ₹35-60 per sq meter (₹3,710-6,360 per house)

**Option 3: No Underlayment** - RISKY
- Traditional method (tiles directly on battens)
- Works IF tiles are high quality and properly overlapped
- **Risk:** Tiles can crack, shift in earthquake, or be displaced by strong wind → roof leaks
- **NOT recommended for Kurukshetra** (monsoon climate, better to have backup waterproofing)

**RECOMMENDED:** Option 2 (Synthetic underlayment)
- Worth extra cost for 25-30 year lifespan (matches tiles)
- Superior waterproofing (peace of mind during heavy monsoon)

---

## 🌡️ ROOF INSULATION (CRITICAL for Kurukshetra Heat)

**Why Insulation is Essential:**
- Kurukshetra summer: 40-45°C outdoor temperature
- Uninsulated roof: Attic reaches 60-70°C (heat radiates into house)
- With insulation: Attic 45-50°C, indoor temp 8-10°C cooler

**Insulation Options:**

### Option 1: Rockwool (Mineral Wool) ⭐ BEST Performance

**What:** Spun mineral fibers (made from volcanic rock and slag)

**Specifications:**
- **Thickness:** 4 inches (100mm)
- **Density:** 60-80 kg/m³
- **R-value:** 3.1 per inch × 4 inches = **R-12.4** (excellent)

**Installation:**
- Lay batts between rafters (friction-fit, no adhesive needed)
- OR lay over ceiling joists (if you have flat ceiling below rafters)
- Cut to fit around electrical wires, plumbing

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Best R-value per inch (most effective)
- ✅ Fire-resistant (non-combustible, Class A rating)
- ✅ Water-resistant (doesn't absorb moisture like fiberglass)
- ✅ Pest-resistant (termites, rodents don't eat it)
- ✅ Doesn't sag or settle over time

**Disadvantages:**
- ⚠️ Most expensive option
- ⚠️ Can irritate skin during installation (wear gloves, long sleeves)

**Cost:**
- ₹150-200 per sq meter (4-inch thickness)
- Per house: 106 sq m × ₹175 = **₹18,550 per house**

---

### Option 2: Straw Bale ⭐ SUSTAINABLE, Budget-Friendly

**What:** Compacted wheat or rice straw, bound with wire/twine

**Specifications:**
- **Thickness:** 4-6 inches (100-150mm) - use 2-3 bales stacked
- **Density:** 80-120 kg/m³ (compressed)
- **R-value:** 2.5-3.0 per inch × 4 inches = **R-10 to R-12** (very good)

**Installation:**
- Lay bales between rafters (on top of ceiling, below roof deck)
- Wire or string bales together (prevent shifting)
- Compress to fit tightly (no air gaps)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Very cheap (₹20-40 per bale, maybe FREE from your farm!)
- ✅ Excellent insulation (nearly as good as rockwool)
- ✅ Breathable (allows moisture vapor to pass)
- ✅ Carbon-negative (sequesters CO₂, sustainable)
- ✅ Biodegradable (end of life, compost it)

**Disadvantages:**
- ⚠️ Fire risk (MUST treat with borax fire retardant)
- ⚠️ Rodent nesting risk (cats and wire mesh mitigate)
- ⚠️ Moisture risk (MUST keep dry - roof must be watertight first)
- ⚠️ Settling over time (may need to add more straw every 10-15 years)

**Fire Treatment (MANDATORY):**
- Spray with borax solution (1 kg borax : 5 liters water)
- Soak thoroughly (straw should be damp, not dripping)
- Let dry 24-48 hours before covering
- Cost: ₹500-1,000 per house

**Cost:**
- Straw: ₹30-50 per bale (or FREE from your farm wheat/rice harvest)
- Quantity: 106 sq m ÷ 0.5 sq m per bale = **212 bales per house**
- Cost: 212 × ₹40 = ₹8,480 per house (or FREE if on-farm)
- Fire treatment: ₹500-1,000 per house
- **Total: ₹9,000-10,000 per house** (or ₹500-1,000 if on-farm straw)

---

### Option 3: Reflective Foil Insulation (Radiant Barrier)

**What:** Aluminum foil laminated to bubble wrap or foam

**Specifications:**
- **Thickness:** 5-10mm (thin)
- **R-value:** R-3 to R-5 (LOW compared to rockwool/straw)
- **Radiant heat reflection:** 95%+ (this is where it shines)

**Installation:**
- Staple to underside of rafters (foil side facing down toward attic)
- Leave 1-2 inch air gap between foil and roof deck (critical for effectiveness)

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Very thin (doesn't take up space)
- ✅ Lightweight (easy to install)
- ✅ Moisture barrier (waterproof)
- ✅ Reflects radiant heat (effective in hot climates)

**Disadvantages:**
- ⚠️ Low R-value (not effective for conductive heat)
- ⚠️ MUST have air gap (doesn't work if touching roof deck)
- ⚠️ Not as effective as rockwool or straw (better as supplement)

**Cost:**
- ₹40-80 per sq meter
- Per house: 106 sq m × ₹60 = **₹6,360 per house**

**RECOMMENDED Use:** Supplement to rockwool or straw (install both for maximum cooling)
- Radiant barrier (under roof deck) + Rockwool/Straw (between/over rafters) = **R-15 to R-18 total** (excellent)

---

### Option 4: Spray Foam Insulation (Premium, NOT Recommended)

**Why NOT Recommended:**
- Very expensive (₹300-500 per sq meter = ₹31,800-53,000 per house)
- Requires specialized equipment (not available in rural Kurukshetra)
- Not breathable (can trap moisture in timber structure)
- Petrochemical-based (not eco-friendly for permaculture farm)

---

### Insulation Recommendation for Your Project:

**Best Value: Straw Bale (4 inches) + Radiant Foil Barrier**

**Why:**
- Straw: R-10 to R-12 (excellent thermal resistance)
- Foil: Reflects 95% radiant heat
- Combined: R-13 to R-15 total (exceeds Kurukshetra climate needs)
- Cost: ₹15,000-16,000 per house (if buying straw) OR ₹7,000 per house (if on-farm straw)
- Sustainable: Renewable materials, low embodied energy, carbon-negative

**Installation Steps:**
1. Install synthetic roof underlayment (under tiles)
2. Install radiant foil barrier (staple to underside of rafters, leave 1" air gap)
3. Lay straw bales between rafters OR on top of ceiling joists
4. Compress straw, wire bales together
5. Cover with breathable fabric (burlap or cotton) to contain straw

**Total Insulation Cost per House:** ₹15,000-22,000

---

## 🌬️ ROOF VENTILATION (Hot Air Exhaust)

**Why Ventilation is Critical:**
- Even with insulation, attic gets hot (heat from tiles + residual heat through insulation)
- Trapped hot air (no escape) = hot ceiling = hot house
- Ridge vent: Hot air rises, exits at peak → draws cooler air from eaves → continuous air flow

### Ridge Vent Design

**Type:** Continuous ridge vent (runs full length of ridge)

**Components:**

**1. Ridge Opening:**
- Cut 2-3 inch gap along entire ridge (between roof deck on north and south sides)
- Gap allows hot air to escape

**2. Vent Cover:**
- Raised ridge cap (metal or fiberglass) covers opening
- Allows air out, but keeps rain and pests out
- Design: Louvered or mesh openings on sides

**3. Installation:**
- Install BEFORE ridge tiles
- Ridge tiles sit on top of vent cover (cover is hidden)

**Specifications:**
- **Vent width:** 2-3 inches
- **Vent length:** 28 ft (full house length)
- **Airflow:** 50-100 CFM per foot (continuous passive ventilation)

**Cost:**
- Ridge vent material: ₹100-200 per linear foot
- Per house: 28 ft × ₹150 = **₹4,200 per house**
- Installation labor: ₹1,000-2,000 per house

**Total Ridge Vent Cost:** ₹5,200-6,200 per house

---

### Soffit Vents (Fresh Air Intake)

**Purpose:** Intake vents at eaves allow cool air to enter attic → completes ventilation cycle

**Type:** Continuous soffit vent OR individual vent covers

**Location:** Under eave overhang (soffit area)

**Size:** 2-4 inch wide continuous slot OR 6"×6" vents every 4 feet

**Quantity:** Match ridge vent (1:1 ratio of intake to exhaust for balanced airflow)

**Installation:**
- Cut holes or slots in soffit boards
- Install vent covers (screen to keep pests out)

**Cost:**
- Soffit vent material: ₹50-100 per linear foot
- Per house: 116 ft perimeter ÷ 2 (only north and south eaves) = 58 ft × ₹75 = **₹4,350 per house**

**Total Ventilation Cost (Ridge + Soffit):** ₹9,550-10,550 per house

---

## 🌊 ROOF DRAINAGE (Gutters & Downspouts)

**Why Gutters are Essential:**
- Collect roof runoff (prevent water damage to walls and foundation)
- Channel water away from house (protect CEB walls - see ceb-water-resistance-guide.md)
- Rainwater harvesting (can connect to swales or storage tanks)

### Gutter Specifications

**Gutter Type:** Half-round or K-style (K-style more common, holds more water)

**Material Options:**

**Option 1: Galvanized Steel** ⭐ DURABLE
- **Lifespan:** 20-30 years (with periodic painting)
- **Cost:** ₹60-100 per linear foot
- **Pros:** Strong, handles heavy rainfall, affordable
- **Cons:** Rusts over time (needs paint every 5-10 years)

**Option 2: Aluminum**
- **Lifespan:** 20-30 years (no rusting)
- **Cost:** ₹80-120 per linear foot
- **Pros:** Lightweight, rust-proof, easy to install
- **Cons:** Dents easier than steel, more expensive

**Option 3: PVC/Plastic**
- **Lifespan:** 10-15 years (UV degradation)
- **Cost:** ₹40-80 per linear foot
- **Pros:** Cheapest, rust-proof, DIY-friendly
- **Cons:** Cracks in extreme heat, fades, shorter life

**Option 4: Copper** (Premium, NOT Recommended for budget)
- **Lifespan:** 50-100 years
- **Cost:** ₹300-500 per linear foot (very expensive)
- **Pros:** Beautiful patina, never rusts, longest life
- **Cons:** Expensive, overkill for farm houses

**RECOMMENDED:** Option 1 (Galvanized Steel)
- Best balance of durability, cost, and performance
- 20-30 years is adequate (can replace after 25 years if needed)

---

### Gutter Sizing

**Roof Area per Side:** 569 sq ft (north slope and south slope)

**Rainfall Intensity:** Kurukshetra peak: 50-75mm/hour (2-3 inches/hour during heavy monsoon)

**Gutter Capacity Needed:**
- Formula: Gutter size (sq inches) = Roof area (sq ft) × Rainfall intensity (inches/hr) ÷ 100
- For 569 sq ft roof, 3 inches/hr: 569 × 3 ÷ 100 = **17 sq inches gutter capacity**

**Gutter Size:** 5-inch K-style (cross-sectional area ~20 sq inches) ✓ Adequate

**Alternative:** 4-inch half-round (area ~12.5 sq inches) - Marginal for heavy rainfall

**RECOMMENDED:** 5-inch K-style gutters (handles monsoon peaks comfortably)

---

### Gutter Installation

**Quantity:**
- House perimeter: 116 ft
- Install on all 4 sides (collect water from both north and south slopes)
- **Total gutter length:** 116 ft per house

**Slope:**
- Minimum slope: 1/4 inch drop per 10 feet (toward downspouts)
- For 28 ft run: 28 ÷ 10 × 0.25 = 0.7 inches drop (barely noticeable, but critical for drainage)

**Downspouts:**
- **Quantity:** 4 downspouts (one at each corner)
- **Size:** 3-inch diameter (matches 5-inch gutter)
- **Length:** 10 ft average (wall height + 2 ft above ground)

**Installation:**
- Gutter brackets: Every 2-3 feet (closer spacing for heavy rainfall)
- Downspout straps: Every 6 feet
- Elbow fittings: 2 per downspout (route water away from foundation)

**Downspout Outlet:**
- **Option A:** Splash block (concrete or plastic, directs water 3-5 ft from foundation)
- **Option B:** Underground drain pipe (connects to swale system - BEST)
- **Option C:** Rain barrel (55-gallon, collects water for gardens)

**RECOMMENDED:** Option B (connect to swale or perimeter drainage)

**Process:**
1. **Prepare gable walls:**
   - Top of gable walls must be level (check with spirit level)
   - Mark ridge beam position (centered on wall, correct height)
   - If using timber: Create notch or install beam pocket in wall
   - If using steel: Weld/bolt steel plate to wall top, beam sits on plate

2. **Lift ridge beam into position:**
   - Timber beam: 6"×8"×30 ft weighs ~400 lbs (180 kg) - requires 4-6 workers OR crane
   - Use scaffold or ladder at both gable ends
   - Lift beam, rest on gable walls
   - Check level (beam must be perfectly level along length)
   - Secure beam (anchor to wall with bolts or steel straps)

**Safety:** Ridge beam is heaviest single piece - use proper lifting technique or machinery

---

**Step 2: Rafter Installation (Day 3-7)**

   - Nail to wall plate: 3 nails through bird's mouth
   - Install remaining rafters: Work from one gable to other, maintain 18" spacing
   - Check plumb: Use level on each rafter (must be vertical when viewed from end)

4. **Install collar ties (if required):**
   - Collar ties: Horizontal members connecting rafters (2/3 up from wall plate)
   - Purpose: Prevent rafter spread (outward thrust)
   - Size: 2"×6" boards
   - Spacing: Every 4 feet (every 3rd rafter pair)
   - Install if: Span > 20 ft OR roof pitch < 4:12 (your 30° = 7:12 is OK, but adding them is good practice)

**Timeline:** 5 days for 38 rafters (2 sides × 19 rafters) + collar ties

---

**Step 3: Purlin Installation (Day 8-10)**

**Process:**
1. **Mark purlin positions:**

## 📞 CONTRACTOR SELECTION & HIRING

### Finding a Qualified Roof Contractor

**Where to Look:**
1. **Local Kurukshetra builders** (ask at building material shops)
2. **Recommendations** (neighboring farm projects, village construction)
3. **Online** (IndiaMART, Sulekha, JustDial - search "roofing contractor Kurukshetra")

**Qualifications to Verify:**
- [ ] **Experience:** 5+ years roofing, 3+ Mangalore tile projects
- [ ] **References:** 3-5 previous customers (call them, visit sites)
- [ ] **Insurance:** Workman's compensation (protects you if worker injured)
- [ ] **Tools:** Owns scaffolding, ladders, safety equipment
- [ ] **Crew size:** 3-5 workers (adequate for 6-week timeline)

---

### Getting Quotes (Minimum 3 Quotes)

**What to Request:**
- **Itemized quote:** Materials + labor separated
- **Timeline:** Start date, completion date (in contract)
- **Payment schedule:** 30% deposit, 40% halfway, 30% completion (NEVER 100% upfront)
- **Warranty:** 1-2 years workmanship (roof leaks, structural issues)

**Quote Comparison:**
- Don't just choose cheapest (quality matters for 50-year roof)
- Check material quality (brand names, specifications match your plan?)
- Check labor hours (too-fast timeline = rushed work)
- Check warranty terms (1 year minimum for workmanship)

---

### Red Flags (Avoid These Contractors)

❌ **Refuses to provide references** (bad reputation)
❌ **Demands 100% payment upfront** (scam risk)
❌ **Quote is 30%+ lower than others** (cutting corners, using inferior materials)
❌ **Vague timeline** ("2-3 months, maybe") - no accountability
❌ **No written contract** (verbal agreements = disputes later)
❌ **Pressure to sign immediately** ("deal expires today!") - scam tactic

## ✅ FINAL RECOMMENDATIONS

### Summary: Best Roof Design for Your Project

**Roof Structure:** Timber trusses (Sal rafters, Mango purlins/battens)

**Roof Covering:** Mangalore tiles (semi-cylindrical, red terracotta)

**Roof Pitch:** 30° (optimal for Kurukshetra: solar + rain + structural efficiency)

**Overhangs:** 
- South/West: 3 ft (maximum CEB wall protection, passive cooling)
- North/East: 2 ft (adequate protection, cost-effective)

**Insulation:** Straw bales (4 inches) + Radiant foil barrier

**Ventilation:** Continuous ridge vent + soffit vents (complete hot air exhaust system)

**Drainage:** Galvanized steel gutters (5-inch K-style) + downspouts to swales

**Cost:** ₹2,40,000-3,30,000 per house (timber option)

**Timeline:** 6 weeks per house (can do 2 houses in parallel = 3 months for all 4)

### Why This Design is Perfect for Your Permaculture Farm

✅ **Climate-Adapted:**
- 30° slope: Ideal for Kurukshetra latitude, handles monsoon rain, supports solar panels
- Extended overhangs: Protects CEB walls (see ceb-water-resistance-guide.md), provides passive cooling
- Insulation + ventilation: 8-10°C cooler indoors (reduces need for AC)

✅ **Sustainable:**
- Timber: Renewable material (choose sustainably-sourced)
- Mangalore tiles: Local clay, 50-100 year lifespan (low replacement frequency)
- Straw insulation: On-farm resource, carbon-negative

✅ **Cost-Effective:**
- Timber cheaper than steel (₹20,000-45,000 savings per house)
- Straw insulation: FREE if on-farm (vs. ₹18,550 for rockwool)
- Long lifespan: 50-60 years (one-time investment)

✅ **Solar-Ready:**
- 30° slope: Optimal for panel efficiency (no adjustment needed)
- Timber structure: Easy to attach tile hooks (wood accepts screws)
- Strong enough: Supports 9-10 panels per house (verified by structural calcs)

✅ **Low Maintenance:**
- Mangalore tiles: No painting, minimal repairs (replace cracked tiles as needed)
- Gutters: Clean twice yearly (simple task)
- Timber treatment: Re-apply borax every 10-15 years (inexpensive)
