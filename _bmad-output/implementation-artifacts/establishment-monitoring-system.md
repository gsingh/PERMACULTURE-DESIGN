## 📞 QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

**This monitoring system is alive and adaptive.**

- If a task feels too time-consuming, simplify it.
- If an issue arises not covered here, document it and add to system.
- If families feel overwhelmed, reduce frequency (but don't skip entirely).
- If something works really well, share with other permaculture farmers!

**Remember:** Monitoring is not a burden, it's an **early warning system** that prevents small problems from becoming catastrophic failures. The time invested in monitoring saves 10x the time/money in emergency repairs.

**Document Status:** Ready for implementation  
**Next Review:** After first 90 days (adjust frequency and checklists based on family feedback)
