## ⚠️ CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### DO's ✅

- ✅ **Plant in MONSOON (July-Aug)** - 70% of tree mortality is wrong timing!
- ✅ **Water consistently (Year 1-3)** - Weekly minimum, daily in extreme heat
- ✅ **Mulch heavily (4-6 inches)** - 40-50% water savings
- ✅ **Protect high-value Shisham** - Tree guards, GPS tagging, theft prevention
- ✅ **Diversify species (15-25 types)** - Disease/pest insurance
- ✅ **Celebrate milestones** - Tree planting ceremony, first harvest, Year 25, Year 30!
- ✅ **Engage children** - Adopt trees, measure annually, lifetime connection
- ✅ **Document everything** - Photos, measurements, lessons learned

### DON'Ts ❌

- ❌ **DON'T plant in summer (March-June)** - 50-70% mortality!
- ❌ **DON'T skip Year 1-3 watering** - Trees die, entire investment lost
- ❌ **DON'T harvest too early** - Shisham needs 25-30 years (patience!)
- ❌ **DON'T plant Eucalyptus monoculture** - 9 trees max (20%), not 100!
- ❌ **DON'T forget firebreaks** - Fire can destroy 10+ years of work
- ❌ **DON'T skip tree guards** - Animals damage young trees (permanent loss)
- ❌ **DON'T neglect legal compliance** - Get timber transport permits (avoid confiscation)
