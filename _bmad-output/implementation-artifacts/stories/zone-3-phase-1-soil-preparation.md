## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns
- **Permaculture Zone Pattern:** Zone 3 implements production zone (medium intensity, 1-3 visits/week) positioned between Zone 2 (high intensity) and Zone 4 (minimal intervention)
- **Swale Integration Pattern:** Zone 3 situated between two water capture swales (Swale 2 @ 160ft north, Swale 3 @ 195ft north) enabling gravity-fed irrigation from swale outlets
- **Linear Spacing Pattern:** Zone 3 organized in linear rows (Row 1: orchard, Row 2: annual crops, Row 3: biomass/fodder, Row 4: compost) running east-west along property, 10ft-35ft width per row
- **Access Path Pattern:** Main access paths along northern and southern edges of Zone 3 connecting to Zone 2 (north) and Zone 4 (south) enabling 4-family coordinated movement
- **Transition Zone Pattern:** Zone 3 represents transition from intensive (Zone 1) to extensive (Zone 4), designed for moderate maintenance (1-3 visits/week) and high production (main food security)

### Constraints
- **Soil Condition:** Alkaline (pH 7.5-8.5) requires pH management strategy (sulfur application if pH > 8.5 or organic matter buffering if pH 7.5-8.5)
- **Low Organic Matter:** Initial 1-2% organic matter requires 5-year organic matter building plan to reach 8-10% optimal level (increase by 2-3% per year = 10-15% by Year 5)
- **Climate Constraints:** Semi-arid Kurukshetra with 40°C+ summers requires heat-tolerant species and irrigation planning (drip irrigation 70% water savings vs flood irrigation)
- **Monsoon Vulnerability:** 450-600mm rainfall July-September creates waterlogging risk, requires raised beds (6-8 inch height) for annual crops, proper drainage from swales
- **Topography:** North-to-south gradient enables gravity-fed irrigation from swales but requires proper drainage design to prevent waterlogging in Zone 3 during heavy monsoon
- **Budget Constraints:** Phase 1 budget ₹25,000-40,000 for 4 families = ₹6,250-10,000 per family, must be approved before procurement

### Testing Standards
- **Soil Testing Quality:** Follow standard soil sampling protocol (composite 5-core samples from 0-12cm and 12-24cm depths, minimum 10 cores per sample location) ensuring representative analysis
- **Pressure Testing:** Perform drip system pressure test (minimum 25 PSI at manifold, 30 PSI at emitters) ensuring adequate water delivery to all Zone 3 zones
- **Leak Testing:** Conduct 30-minute system leak test before planting, verify all connections are moisture-free and system holds pressure
- **Emitter Uniformity Test:** Randomly sample 10% of emitters and verify 10% flow rate variance (within ±0.5 GPH tolerance) ensuring uniform water distribution
- **Path Drainage Test:** Simulate heavy rainfall (1 inch/hour for 30 min) and verify paths drain adequately without creating erosion

### Project Structure Notes
- **Module Alignment:** Zone 3 implementation aligns with permaculture farm development workflow (Phase 1: Soil preparation → Phase 2: Permanent elements → Phase 3: Annual production → Phase 4: System optimization)
- **Zone 3 Integration:** Zone 3 produces compost for Zone 1 gardens and Zone 2 animals, receives biomass from Zone 3 nitrogen fixers for animal fodder, connects to swales for water management (between Swale 2 @ 160ft and Swale 3 @ 195ft)
- **Coordination Requirements:** Zone 3 requires coordination with Zone 2 (animal manure sourcing) and future Zone 1 (compost distribution), establish Zone 3 coordinator role for 4-family management
- **Compost System Scale:** 3-bay compost system at Zone 3 is largest on farm (total 192 sq ft production = 18-20 tons/year capacity) serving entire farm's fertility needs (Zones 1, 2, 3, and 4)

### Risk Mitigation
- **Pest Risk:** Zone 3 orchard vulnerable to mango fruit fly, powdery mildew - mitigation includes resistant varieties (Kesar mango), proper spacing (8-10ft), integrated pest management (Zone 2 chickens/ducks foraging, biological controls)
- **Climate Risk:** 40°C+ temperatures in summer can stress young trees - mitigation includes shade cloth during establishment (Year 1-2), proper irrigation timing (early morning), heat-tolerant varieties
- **Soil Degradation Risk:** Alkaline soil + low organic matter = poor fertility - mitigation includes massive compost addition (10-15 tons/acre in Year 1), 5-year organic matter building plan (2% → 10% by Year 5), pH monitoring and adjustment (sulfur if pH > 8.5)
- **Water Risk:** Drought potential in semi-arid climate - mitigation includes swale integration (captures 80-90% rainfall), drip irrigation (70% water savings), pond backup connection (gravity-fed from SE corner)
- **Labor Risk:** 4 families may lack orchard management skills - mitigation includes specialist training (₹5,000-8,000), detailed reference guides, standard operating procedures

### Technology Stack
- **Irrigation:** Gravity-fed drip system (no pumps needed = energy savings), HDPE mainline with emitters (1,672 emitters @ 3.344ft spacing), Y-strainer + zone valves for filtration and pressure regulation
- **Soil Analysis:** Professional soil testing lab analysis (pH, organic matter, NPK, texture, drainage rate) creating baseline for 5-year organic matter building plan
- **Composting:** 3-bay rotational system (fresh → active → finished), wooden pallet construction, zone coordinator tracking (weekly/monthly turning cycles)
- **Communication:** Family meetings (face-to-face preferred), printed operating procedures, WhatsApp group for daily coordination
- **Documentation:** Spreadsheet budget tracking, printed guides, photo documentation of pests/diseases
