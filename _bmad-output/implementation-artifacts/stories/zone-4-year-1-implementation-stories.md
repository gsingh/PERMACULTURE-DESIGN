- Time per worker: 15-20 pits/day (experienced diggers)
- Total: 316 pits ÷ (4 workers x 18 pits/day) = ~5 days
- Cost: 4 workers x ₹500 x 5 days = ₹10,000
- Benefits: Fast, professional, families can focus on other tasks

**Option C: Hybrid (Families + Hired Labor)**
- Families dig 100 pits (easier Row 4, smaller shrubs)
- Hire labor for 216 pits (larger Row 1-3 trees)
- Cost: ₹6,000-8,000
- Timeline: 1 weekend (families) + 3 days (hired)

**RECOMMENDATION: Option B (Hire Labor)**
- 316 pits is HUGE effort (132 hours!)
- Families save energy for planting (July-August)
- Professional diggers faster, more consistent depth
- ₹10,000 is ~10% of total budget (worth it!)

**Materials Needed:**
- Shovels/spades (4-6): ₹2,000-3,000 (if not owned)
- Pickaxes (2-3): ₹1,500-2,000 (for hard soil/rocks)
- Measuring stick (2 ft marker): ₹100-200 (verify depth)
- Wheelbarrows (2): ₹4,000-6,000 (transport soil)
- Water for workers: ₹500/day (April-May heat!)
- **Total (if purchasing tools):** ₹8,000-12,000
- **Note:** Tools are reusable for future farm projects

**Pit Digging Protocol:**
1. Start at western end, work eastward (systematic)
2. Dig to 2 ft depth (verify with measuring stick)
3. Pile excavated soil 1-2 ft from pit (avoid collapse)
4. Check for rocks, roots (remove obstacles)
5. If hardpan encountered at 1.5 ft: Break through (critical for drainage)
6. Mark completed pits (stake or flag)

**Quality Control:**
- Site supervisor checks 10% of pits (random sample)
- Verify: 2 ft depth, 2 ft width, clean sides
- Re-dig any undersized pits

### Story 1.9: Tree Guard Procurement

**As a** animal protection coordinator  
**I want to** source and prepare tree guards for all saplings  
**So that** animals don't damage young trees

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Tree guard design selected (wire mesh, bamboo, or plastic)
- [ ] Quantity ordered: 316 guards (all trees/shrubs)
- [ ] Specifications: 3 ft tall, 2 ft diameter (Row 1-2); 2 ft tall, 1.5 ft diameter (Row 3-4)
- [ ] Material sourced (purchased or DIY)
- [ ] Guards pre-assembled (if DIY)
- [ ] Stored safely until planting (July)
- [ ] Installation hardware ready (stakes, ties)

**Story Points:** 5  
**Sprint:** Sprint 6 (June 2026)  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Dependencies:** Nursery order (know exact tree count)  
**Owner:** Family 4 (Documentation & Logistics)

**Tree Guard Options:**

**Option A: Wire Mesh Guards (BEST for durability)**

**Design:**
- Material: 1-inch chicken wire or welded wire mesh
- Height: 3 ft (Row 1-2), 2 ft (Row 3-4)
- Diameter: 2 ft (Row 1-2), 1.5 ft (Row 3-4)
- Shape: Cylinder (open top for growth)
- Support: 3 stakes per guard (bamboo or metal)

**Cost Calculation:**
- Wire mesh (Roll: 50 ft x 3 ft): ₹500-800 per roll
- Rolls needed: 316 guards x 6 ft circumference = 1,896 ft ÷ 50 ft = ~38 rolls
- Mesh cost: 38 rolls x ₹650 = ₹24,700
- Stakes (3 per guard): 948 stakes @ ₹10-15 = ₹9,480-14,220
- Wire ties: ₹1,000-2,000
- **TOTAL:** ₹35,180-40,920

**Benefits:**
✅ Durable (5-10 year lifespan)
✅ Ventilation (doesn't restrict airflow)
✅ Visibility (can see tree inside)
✅ Reusable (move to new trees later)

**Drawbacks:**
❌ Expensive (₹110-130 per guard)
❌ Labor-intensive (cutting, assembly, installation)

---

**Option B: Bamboo Guards (ECO-FRIENDLY, cheapest)**

**Design:**
- Material: Bamboo poles (6-8 per guard)
- Height: 3 ft
- Diameter: 2 ft (hexagonal shape)
- Support: Self-supporting (poles lashed together)

**Cost Calculation:**
- Bamboo poles (6 ft long): ₹20-30 each
- Poles needed: 316 guards x 7 poles = 2,212 poles
- Bamboo cost: 2,212 x ₹25 = ₹55,300
- Rope/twine for lashing: ₹2,000-3,000
- **TOTAL:** ₹57,300-58,300

**Wait, this is MORE expensive than wire mesh?**

**Revised Option B: Thorny Brush Barriers (FREE!)**
- Source: Prunings from nearby trees (thorny species)
- Design: Pile thorny branches around each sapling (3 ft radius)
- Cost: ₹0 (labor only)
- Lifespan: 1-2 years (enough for establishment)
- Benefits: Free, organic, effective against large animals
- Drawbacks: Aesthetically messy, need to replace annually

---

**Option C: Plastic Guards (MODERATE cost)**
- Material: Plastic tree shelter tubes (commercial)
- Height: 2-3 ft
- Diameter: 4-6 inches (snug fit around sapling trunk)
- Cost: ₹50-100 per guard x 316 = ₹15,800-31,600
- Benefits: Easy installation, UV-stabilized (3-5 year lifespan)
- Drawbacks: Less ventilation, can overheat saplings in summer

---

**RECOMMENDATION: Hybrid Approach**
- **Row 1 (High-value timber):** Wire mesh guards (46 guards) = ₹5,060-5,980
- **Row 2-3 (Moderate value):** Plastic guards (157 guards) = ₹7,850-15,700
- **Row 4 (Shrubs, thorny species):** Thorny brush barriers (113 guards) = ₹0
- **TOTAL:** ₹12,910-21,680 (within budget!)

**DIY Assembly (Wire Mesh Guards):**

**Materials per guard:**
- Wire mesh: 6 ft x 3 ft section
- Stakes: 3 x (4 ft bamboo poles)
- Wire ties: 10-12

**Assembly Steps:**
1. Cut wire mesh to 6 ft length, 3 ft height
2. Roll into cylinder (2 ft diameter)
3. Secure overlap with wire ties (every 6 inches)
4. Position 3 stakes equally spaced around cylinder (inside)
5. Tie stakes to mesh (top, middle, bottom)
6. Leave open top (tree grows through)

**Labor:**
- 1 person can assemble 5-8 guards/hour
- 46 guards ÷ 6 guards/hr = ~8 hours
- Team of 4: 2 hours (family activity!)

**Timeline:** 1 day (June weekend)

**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Dependencies:** Story 2.1 (saplings delivered)  
**Owner:** Family 1 + Family 2

**Planting Schedule (Row 1 - 46 trees):**

**Day 1-2: Shisham (18 trees) - HIGHEST PRIORITY**
- Team: 4-6 people (all families, focus on quality)
- Rate: 8-10 trees/day (slow, careful planting)
- Timeline: 2 days (July 12-13)

**Day 3: Neem (9 trees)**
- Team: 3-4 people
- Rate: 9 trees/day
- Timeline: 1 day (July 14)

**Day 4: Eucalyptus (9 trees)**
- Team: 3-4 people
- Rate: 9 trees/day
- Timeline: 1 day (July 15)

**Day 5: Mango + Jamun (10 trees total)**
- Team: 3-4 people
- Rate: 10 trees/day
- Timeline: 1 day (July 16)

**TOTAL: 5 days (July 12-16)**

**Step-by-Step Planting Protocol:**

**1. Pit Preparation (5-10 min per tree)**
- Check pit depth: 2 ft deep (measure with stick)
- Check backfill: 80% filled with amended soil (compost mixed in)
- Create center mound: Small cone of soil in pit center (for root ball to sit on)
- Water pit: Pour 5-10 liters (pre-wet soil)

**2. Sapling Preparation (5 min per tree)**
- Gently remove sapling from pot/burlap
- Inspect roots: Lightly tease apart if root-bound (circular roots)
- Trim any broken/damaged roots (clean cut with pruners)
- Keep root ball intact (don't shake off all soil!)

**3. Positioning (5-10 min per tree)**
- Place sapling on center mound in pit
- Adjust height: Root crown (where trunk meets roots) at final soil level
  - **CRITICAL:** Not too deep (root crown buried = tree death!)
  - **CRITICAL:** Not too shallow (roots exposed = drying out)
- Check vertical: Use level or visual sight (straight up, not tilted)
- Rotate sapling: Best side facing primary view direction (aesthetic)

**4. Backfilling (10-15 min per tree)**
- Add amended soil around root ball (shovel carefully, don't drop soil on crown)
- Fill in layers: 6 inches at a time
- Firm gently: Press soil with hands (remove air pockets, but don't compact hard!)
- Continue until pit filled to original ground level
- Create slight depression around trunk: Watering basin (3 ft diameter, 3-4 inch deep)

**5. Initial Watering (5-10 min per tree)**
- Pour 20-30 liters slowly into watering basin
- Wait for water to infiltrate (don't let it run off!)
- Observe: Soil should settle slightly (add more soil if large air pockets appear)
- Goal: Soil moist but not waterlogged (squeeze test: holds shape but doesn't drip)

**6. Tree Guard Installation (10-15 min per tree)**
- Position wire mesh guard around sapling (2 ft diameter)
- Drive 3 stakes into ground (outside guard, evenly spaced)
- Tie guard to stakes with wire (secure but not strangling)
- Check: Guard is stable (shake test - shouldn't wobble)
- Check: Guard doesn't touch sapling trunk (2-3 inch gap)

**7. Mulching (5-10 min per tree)**
- Apply 4-6 inch layer of straw/leaves (2-3 ft radius)
- Keep mulch 6 inches away from trunk (prevent rot)
- Spread evenly (donut shape, not volcano!)

**8. Tagging & Documentation (5 min per tree)**
- Install tree tag (metal or plastic, write with permanent marker)
  - Species: "Shisham (Dalbergia sissoo)"
  - Planted: "July 12, 2026"
  - Assigned to: "Kumar Family"
- Take photo (close-up + wide shot showing location)
- Record GPS: For high-value Shisham (18 trees)
- Log in digital registry (tree ID, species, date, location, photo)

**TOTAL TIME PER TREE: 50-85 minutes (including breaks)**
**TOTAL LABOR (46 trees):** 38-65 hours
**Team of 4-6 people:** 6-11 hours per person over 5 days (manageable!)

---

**Quality Control Checkpoints:**

**Supervisor Role:** 1 designated person checks random 10% of trees (5 trees)

**Check 1: Planting Depth**
- Inspect root crown: At soil level? (not buried, not exposed)
- Adjust if needed (add or remove soil)

**Check 2: Watering Basin**
- Holds water? (no leaks, 3 ft diameter)
- Adequate depth? (3-4 inches)

**Check 3: Tree Guard Stability**
- Shake test (shouldn't wobble)
- Clearance (doesn't touch trunk)

**Check 4: Mulch**
- Thickness (4-6 inches)
- Clearance from trunk (6 inches)

**If issues found:** Re-train team, adjust technique for remaining trees

- Rate: 20-22 plants/day
- Timeline: 2 days (July 26-27)

**TOTAL: 5 days (July 23-27)**

**Bamboo Planting (Special Protocol):**

**Pit Size:** 3 ft x 3 ft x 2 ft (larger than tree pits, bamboo spreads!)

**Planting Steps:**
1. Place bamboo clump in pit (root mass + some shoots)
2. Backfill with amended soil
3. Water heavily (30-40 liters)
4. Mulch (6-8 inch layer, larger area = 3 ft radius)
5. Mark 5 ft diameter clearance (bamboo will fill this space in 3-5 years)

**Containment (Optional):**
- If concerned about bamboo spreading: Install underground barrier (2 ft deep sheet metal or thick plastic)
- Cost: ₹200-300 per clump x 45 = ₹9,000-13,500
- **Recommendation:** Skip barriers (Zone 4 is semi-wild, bamboo spread is beneficial)

**Labor:** 6-8 people, 6-8 hours/day x 5 days = 30-40 hours total

- [ ] Signage installed ("Native Wildflower Area - Let Grow Wild!")

**Story Points:** 3  
**Sprint:** Sprint 9 (Late July or Early Aug 2026)  
**Priority:** LOW  
**Dependencies:** Weather (monsoon rain ideal)  
**Owner:** Family 4

**Seeding Protocol:**

**Step 1: Soil Prep (2-3 hours, all families)**
- Light raking (remove large rocks, debris)
- Break up clumps (surface should be loose)
- DON'T till deep (preserve soil structure)

**Step 2: Seed Mixing (30 min)**
- Mix seed with 10-15 kg sand (bulks it up, easier to broadcast evenly)
- Divide into 4 portions (sow in 4 passes for even coverage)

**Step 3: Broadcasting (1-2 hours)**
- Walk in grid pattern (north-south, then east-west)
- Cast seed by hand (throw gently, wide arc)
- Overlap passes slightly (ensure no bare patches)

**Step 4: Covering (1 hour)**
- Light raking (barely cover seed, 1/4 inch deep)
- Or: No covering (many wildflower seeds need light to germinate)

**Step 5: Watering (if needed)**
- If no rain within 3 days: Sprinkler irrigation (light watering daily until germination)
- Once established (4-6 weeks): No watering needed (native species drought-adapted)

**Expected Germination:** 2-4 weeks (monsoon moisture ideal)

**Labor:** 4-6 hours total (all families, fun activity for children!)

## EPIC 3: POST-PLANTING CARE (AUG-DEC 2026)

### Story 3.1: Weekly Watering (Monsoon Tail + Early Dry Season)

**As a** tree survival coordinator  
**I want to** ensure consistent watering through first dry season  
**So that** saplings establish deep roots and survive Year 1

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Watering schedule established (weekly, Aug-Dec)
- [ ] Irrigation system operational (drip or manual)
- [ ] All 316 trees watered (20-30 liters each, per session)
- [ ] Soil moisture monitored (hand-feel test, adjust frequency if needed)
- [ ] Labor rotation system (families alternate weeks)
- [ ] Watering log maintained (dates, quantities, issues)

**Story Points:** 13 (ONGOING, high labor)  
**Sprint:** Sprints 10-14 (Aug-Dec 2026, 20 weeks)  
**Priority:** CRITICAL  
**Dependencies:** Irrigation system (Story 1.8)  
**Owner:** Family 3 (Water Lead), rotated weekly

**Watering Protocol:**

**Aug-Sept (Monsoon Tail):**
- Frequency: Every 7-10 days (supplement monsoon rain)
- Quantity: 20 liters per tree (lighter, rain provides rest)
- Method: Drip (if installed) or manual (hose/buckets)
- Check: If heavy rain (>20mm) in past 5 days, SKIP watering

**Oct-Nov (Early Dry Season):**
- Frequency: Every 5-7 days (rain decreases)
- Quantity: 25-30 liters per tree
- Method: Deep watering (slow, let infiltrate)
- Check: Soil moisture (dig 6 inches, should be slightly moist)

**Dec (Winter):**
- Frequency: Every 10-14 days (cooler, less evaporation)
- Quantity: 20 liters per tree
- Method: Manual (drip system may freeze if cold)

**Labor per Watering Session:**
- Drip system: 2-3 hours setup (turn on, monitor, turn off)
- Manual: 10-15 hours (316 trees x 2-3 min per tree)

**Weekly Rotation (Manual Watering):**
- Week 1: Family 1 (Kumar)
- Week 2: Family 2 (Sharma)
- Week 3: Family 3 (Singh)
- Week 4: Family 4 (Verma)
- Cycle repeats

**If a family can't do their week:** Swap with another family OR hire labor (₹500-800 for day's watering)

**Watering Log Template:**

```
ZONE 4 WATERING LOG - 2026

Date | Family | Method | Duration (hrs) | Water Used (liters) | Trees Watered | Issues | Soil Moisture (1-10)

### Story 3.2: Monthly Tree Health Checks

**As a** tree health monitor  
**I want to** inspect all trees monthly for stress, pests, disease  
**So that** we catch problems early and intervene before tree death

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Monthly inspections completed (Aug-Dec, 5 months)
- [ ] 10% random sample checked closely (32 trees)
- [ ] 100% visual scan for obvious issues (all trees)
- [ ] Issues documented (pest, disease, nutrient deficiency, mechanical damage)
- [ ] Interventions implemented (pruning, pest control, extra watering)
- [ ] Struggling trees flagged (replacement candidates)

**Story Points:** 5 (per month, x5 months = 25 total)  
**Sprint:** Sprints 10-14 (Aug-Dec 2026)  
**Priority:** HIGH  
**Dependencies:** Baseline planting data (Story 2.7)  
**Owner:** Rotating (each family takes 1 month)

**Inspection Protocol:**

**Visual Scan (All 316 trees, 2-3 hours):**
- Walk each row, look for:
  - Dead trees (brown, brittle leaves)
  - Wilting (leaves drooping, even after watering)
  - Discoloration (yellowing, unusual spots)
  - Pest damage (holes, webs, chewed leaves)
  - Mechanical damage (broken branches, guard rubbing trunk)

**Detailed Inspection (32 trees, 1-2 hours):**
- Randomly select:
  - 5 trees Row 1 (10%)
  - 7 trees Row 2 (10%)
  - 9 trees Row 3 (10%)
  - 11 trees Row 4 (10%)

- Check:
  - **Leaves:** Color, shape, texture (compare to healthy reference)
  - **Stem:** Bark integrity, no oozing, no cracks
  - **Soil:** Moisture level (hand-feel, 6 inches deep)
  - **Root collar:** No soil piled against trunk (rot risk)
  - **Guard:** Not rubbing trunk, stable
  - **Mulch:** Still 4-6 inches thick (replenish if thin)
  - **Pests:** Look for insects, eggs, webs

**Common Issues (First Year):**

**Issue 1: Transplant Shock (Wilting despite watering)**
- Cause: Roots damaged during planting
- Solution: Extra watering (daily for 1-2 weeks), shade cloth temporarily
- Expected: 5-10% of trees (normal)

**Issue 2: Nutrient Deficiency (Yellowing leaves)**
- Cause: Alkaline soil (iron, nitrogen deficiency common in Haryana)
- Solution: Foliar spray (liquid fertilizer), compost tea
- Prevention: Annual compost top-dressing

**Issue 3: Pest Attack (Aphids, caterpillars)**
- Cause: Young, tender leaves attractive to pests
- Solution: Neem oil spray (organic), hand-pick caterpillars
- Prevention: Encourage beneficial insects (plant flowers nearby)

**Issue 4: Borers (Holes in trunk, sawdust)**
- Cause: Beetle larvae boring into trunk
- Solution: Wire into hole (kill larvae), prune affected branch
- Prevention: Healthy trees resist borers (good watering, nutrition)

**Issue 5: Mechanical Damage (Broken branches)**
- Cause: Wind, animals, human error
- Solution: Prune cleanly (disinfect pruners), protect with better guard
- Prevention: Reinforce guards, educate families

**Intervention Matrix:**

| Severity | Action | Timeline |
|----------|--------|----------|
| **Minor** (1-2 affected trees) | Monitor, minor treatment (neem spray) | Next inspection (1 month) |
| **Moderate** (5-10 affected trees) | Active treatment, increase watering | Weekly checks (1 month) |
| **Severe** (>10 affected OR tree death) | Emergency response, consult expert, replace dead trees | Immediate (24-48 hrs) |

**Monthly Health Report (Submit to all families):**

### Story 3.3: Replacement Planting (Dead/Struggling Trees)

**As a** survival rate manager  
**I want to** identify and replace dead or dying trees  
**So that** we maintain 80-90% survival rate by Year 1 end

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Dead trees identified (from monthly health checks)
- [ ] Cause of death documented (for learning)
- [ ] Replacement saplings ordered (same species)
- [ ] Planting window utilized (Sept-Oct, or next monsoon)
- [ ] Replacement trees tagged (note: "Replacement - Sept 2026")
- [ ] Final Year 1 survival rate calculated (Dec 2026)

**Story Points:** 5  
**Sprint:** Sprints 11-14 (Sept-Dec 2026)  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Dependencies:** Monthly health checks (Story 3.2)  
**Owner:** Family 1 (Nursery Liaison)

**Expected Mortality:**
- 10-20% loss normal for Year 1 (30-60 trees)
- Causes: Transplant shock, drought stress, pests, poor stock, planting error

**Replacement Budget:**
- Saplings: 30-60 @ ₹40-150 = ₹1,200-9,000
- Included in Year 1 budget (₹5,000-10,000 buffer)

**Replacement Protocol:**

**Step 1: Confirm Death (Not Just Dormancy)**
- Scratch test: Scratch bark with fingernail (green underneath = alive!)
- Bend test: Bend small twig (snaps = dead, bends = alive)
- Wait: Some species drop leaves (dormancy), not dead
- Decision: If 100% certain dead, remove and replace

**Step 2: Document & Learn**
- Photo dead tree (before removal)
- Inspect root ball (dig up carefully)
- Document cause (if identifiable):
  - Roots black/rotten: Overwatering or poor drainage
  - Roots dry: Underwatering
  - Trunk holes: Borers
  - Leaves spotted: Disease
  - Unknown: Note for future reference
- Log in registry (tree ID, date died, probable cause)

**Step 3: Order Replacement**
- Same species (maintain design diversity)
- Order 20% extra (buffer for future mortality)
- Coordinate with nursery (Sept-Oct delivery for planting)

**Step 4: Replanting**
- Timing: Sept-Oct (post-monsoon) OR July 2027 (next monsoon)
- Use same pit (replace soil if disease suspected)
- Follow planting protocol (Story 2.2)
- Tag clearly: "Replacement - Sept 2026" (differentiate from original cohort)

**Year 1 Survival Rate Calculation (Dec 2026):**

```
Original trees planted: 316
Dead by Dec 2026: 35 (example)
Survival rate: (316 - 35) / 316 = 281 / 316 = 89% ✅

Replaced in Sept 2026: 35
Total trees by Dec 2026: 316 (back to original count)

REPORT:
- Year 1 survival: 89% (EXCELLENT! Target was 80-90%)
- Trees replaced: 35 (11%)
- Causes of death:
  - Transplant shock: 15 trees (43%)
  - Drought stress: 10 trees (29%)
  - Pest damage: 5 trees (14%)
  - Unknown: 5 trees (14%)
```
