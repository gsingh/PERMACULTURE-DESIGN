- **Note**: Goats require MORE infrastructure and daily commitment

**Production Metrics**:
- Milk: 1-2 liters/day per doe
- Kids: 1-2 per year per doe (meat or breeding stock)
- Browser: Controls weeds, prunes lower tree branches
- Manure: Excellent for composting

**Housing Requirements** (if pursued):
- **Location**: Western edge of Zone 2 (access to Zone 3 browsing)
- **Shelter**: 6x8 feet (48 sq ft) = 15-20 sq ft per goat
- **Fencing**: **CRITICAL** - goats escape easily
  - 4-foot woven wire fence minimum
  - Electric wire at top (12 inches above fence)
  - Strong posts every 8 feet
- **Rotational paddocks**: 4 sections (rotate weekly)

**⚠️ SCRUM MASTER RECOMMENDATION**: **START with chickens + ducks ONLY**. Add goats in Year 2-3 once systems proven and family coordination established.

## 4. ROTATIONAL GRAZING/FORAGING SYSTEM

### Chicken Rotation Protocol (8-Week Cycle)

**Week 1-2: Paddock 1**
- Move portable electric netting to Paddock 1
- Chickens scratch, forage, fertilize
- Trees protected with individual guards
- Daily egg collection from coop (adjacent)
- Water stations: 3 locations

**Week 3-4: Paddock 2**
- Shift netting to Paddock 2
- Paddock 1 begins rest period (grass/weed regrowth)
- Monitor manure distribution
- Adjust tree protection as needed

**Week 5-6: Paddock 3**
- Continue rotation
- Paddocks 1-2 actively regenerating
- Scout for pests/issues

**Week 7-8: Paddock 4**
- Final rotation
- Evaluate Paddock 1 readiness (6 weeks rest complete)
- Cycle repeats

**Benefits of 8-Week Cycle**:
- ✅ Breaks parasite lifecycle (6-week rest minimum)
- ✅ Prevents overgrazing/scratching damage
- ✅ Even manure distribution
- ✅ Improved soil health across entire Zone 2
- ✅ Chickens always have fresh forage

---

### Duck Rotation Protocol (6-Week Cycle)

**Week 1-3: Forage Zone 1** (Western section)
- Ducks spend mornings foraging in Zone 1
- Afternoons at pond (swimming, feeding on Azolla)
- Evenings return to duck house (near pond)
- Focus: Pest control around young fruit trees

**Week 4-6: Forage Zone 2** (Center-East section)
- Shift to fresh foraging area
- Zone 1 rests (less pressure than chickens, 3-week rest adequate)
- Continue daily pond access
- Heavy pest reduction

**Daily Schedule** (Ducks):
- **6-7 AM**: Release from duck house → Forage zone
- **11 AM-3 PM**: Pond access (swimming, feeding, cooling)
- **3-6 PM**: Return to forage zone
- **6-7 PM**: Herd to duck house (lock in for predator protection)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Outstanding pest control (slugs, snails decimated)
- ✅ Fertilization while foraging
- ✅ Pond integration (nutrient cycling)
- ✅ Fresh water for ducks daily
- ✅ Less destructive than chickens (no heavy scratching)

---

## 6. ANIMAL INTEGRATION WITH FOOD FOREST

### Food Forest Design (Zone 2)

**Tree Planting Along Swales** (from your existing plan):
- **Swale 1 berm**: Pioneer nitrogen fixers (Gliricidia, Subabul) - 40-50 trees
- **Swale 2 berm**: Fruit trees (Mango, Jamun, Guava) + nitrogen fixers - 40-50 trees
- **Between swales**: Scattered fruit trees, mid-story species - 30-40 trees
- **TOTAL Zone 2 trees**: 110-140 trees

**Animal-Tree Integration Strategies**:

#### **Chickens + Trees**

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Pest control**: Chickens eat beetles, grubs, grasshoppers attacking young trees
- ✅ **Fertilization**: High-nitrogen manure accelerates tree growth
- ✅ **Weed suppression**: Scratching controls weeds around tree bases
- ✅ **Soil aeration**: Scratching improves soil structure

**Challenges**:
- ⚠️ **Bark damage**: Chickens scratch tree bark (protect young trees)
- ⚠️ **Root exposure**: Excessive scratching can expose roots

**Solutions**:
- **Tree guards**: 3-foot diameter wire mesh circles around each tree (first 3-5 years)
- **Timing**: Rotate chickens through areas BEFORE tree planting or AFTER trees established (5+ feet tall)
- **Density management**: No more than 1 chicken per 100 sq ft to prevent overgrazing

---

#### **Ducks + Trees**

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **SUPERIOR pest control**: Ducks eat slugs, snails, insects WITHOUT scratching
- ✅ **Fertilization**: Duck manure excellent for trees
- ✅ **Weed management**: Ducks eat weed seeds, tender shoots
- ✅ **No bark damage**: Ducks don't scratch like chickens

**Challenges**:
- ⚠️ **Tender greens**: Ducks love eating tender leaves (protect very young trees)

**Solutions**:
- **Indian Runner ducks**: Best for pest control, less destructive to plants
- **Timing**: Introduce ducks to areas with established trees (2+ years old)
- **Temporary fencing**: Protect very young saplings until 3 feet tall

---

### Integrated Planting Schedule

**Year 1** (Animal introduction + tree planting):

**Month 1-3** (Prepare Zone 2):
- Install Swale 1 & 2 (already done per your plan)
- Plant nitrogen fixers on swale berms (Gliricidia, Subabul)
- Install tree guards (wire mesh, 3-foot diameter)
- Set up chicken coop + duck house
- Fence rotation paddocks

**Month 4-6** (Introduce animals):
- **Month 4**: Purchase and introduce 20 pullets (young hens, 16-20 weeks old)
  - Start in smaller confined run (transition period, 2-3 weeks)
  - Then release to Paddock 1
- **Month 5**: Purchase 12-15 ducklings (8-12 weeks old)
  - Start near pond in confined area (adaptation, 2-3 weeks)
  - Then release to Forage Zone 1
- **Month 6**: Begin rotation protocol

**Month 7-9** (Tree planting continues):
- Plant fruit trees between swales (scattered pattern)
- Animals continue rotation (fertilizing, clearing weeds)
- Monitor tree protection (adjust guards as needed)

**Month 10-12** (System establishment):
- First eggs from chickens (Month 10-11)
- First eggs from ducks (Month 11-12)
- Trees establishing in fertilized, cleared ground
- Refine rotation timing based on observation

---

**Year 2-3** (System maturation):
- Trees 2-5 feet tall (can reduce guards on some)
- Animals fully integrated (rotation refined)
- Compost system producing high-quality fertilizer
- Nitrogen fixers providing chop-and-drop mulch
- Some fruit production begins (papaya, banana, guava)

**Year 5-10** (Mature food forest):
- Trees 8-15 feet tall (no guards needed)
- Animals free-range more widely
- Heavy fruit production
- System largely self-managing
- Minimal external inputs needed

---

## 7. FEED & NUTRITION STRATEGY

### Chicken Feed Requirements

**Total Feed Needed** (20-25 chickens):
- **Daily**: 5-6 lbs (2.5-3 kg)
- **Monthly**: 150-180 lbs (70-85 kg)
- **Annually**: 1,800-2,200 lbs (850-1,000 kg)

**Feed Sources**:

**Commercial Layer Feed** (60-70% of diet):
- **Type**: Layer pellets or crumbles (16-18% protein)
- **Cost**: ₹30-35/kg
- **Monthly cost**: ₹2,100-3,000
- **Where**: Local feed stores in Kurukshetra

**Farm-Grown Supplements** (30-40% of diet):
- **Kitchen scraps**: Vegetable trimmings from Zone 1 gardens (all 4 families contribute)
- **Forage**: Insects, worms, grasses, seeds from rotation paddocks
- **Compost access**: Chickens scratch through compost piles (insects, organic matter)
- **Azolla**: Grow in small containers (protein-rich duck weed)
- **Moringa leaves**: Chop from drumstick trees (protein supplement)

**Mineral Supplements**:
- **Oyster shell**: Free choice (calcium for strong eggshells)
- **Grit**: Insoluble (aids digestion)
- **Cost**: ₹200-300/month

**Total Monthly Feed Cost**: ₹2,500-3,500 for 20-25 chickens

### Egg Distribution Protocol

**Fairness System** (ALL families contribute equally to care):

**Option A: Equal Split** (RECOMMENDED)
- Total eggs collected weekly: ~100-120 eggs (chickens) + 70-85 eggs (ducks) = 170-205 eggs
- Each family: 42-51 eggs/week (6-7 eggs/day per family)
- **Simple, fair, easy to manage**

**Option B: Labor-Based**
- Family on duty that week gets 30% of eggs
- Remaining 70% split equally among all 4 families
- **Rewards active participation**

**Option C: Purchase System**
- All eggs go to communal "egg bank"
- Families "purchase" eggs at cost (₹3-4/egg, covers feed)
- Profits shared quarterly
- **Good for families with varying consumption**

**⚠️ SCRUM MASTER RECOMMENDATION**: **Start with Option A (equal split)**. Simple, builds trust, easy first year. Adjust Year 2 if needed.

---

### Conflict Resolution Protocol

**Common Issues & Solutions**:

**Issue 1: "Who forgot to close the coop door last night?"**
- **Solution**: Install automatic door closer (₹3,000-5,000) - removes human error
- **Backup**: Daily checklist app (shared among families)

**Issue 2: "Your week to clean, but you didn't!"**
- **Solution**: 
  - Written agreement: If you miss your week, you do NEXT week too + pay ₹500 to community fund
  - Or hire local help (₹200/week) - cost borne by non-performing family

**Issue 3: "Ducks escaped and damaged my Zone 1 garden!"**
- **Solution**:
  - Responsible family that week pays for damage (goodwill gesture)
  - Invest in better fencing (community expense)
  - Adjust duck rotation protocol

**Issue 4: "I want more eggs than my share!"**
- **Solution**:
  - Excess eggs can be "purchased" from communal share (at-cost price)
  - OR increase flock size (community decision, shared cost)

**General Protocol**:
1. **Direct communication**: Address issues immediately, kindly
2. **Monthly review meeting**: All 4 families discuss what's working, what's not
3. **Quarterly adjustment**: Modify protocols based on 3-month data
4. **Written agreements**: Update shared operating document annually
