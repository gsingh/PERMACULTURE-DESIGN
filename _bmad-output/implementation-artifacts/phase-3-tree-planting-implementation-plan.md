## 📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**What is Phase 3?**

Phase 3 establishes the **permanent tree structure** of your permaculture farm - the foundation that will produce for 50-100+ years. This phase covers:

1. ✅ **562-760 trees planted** across all zones
2. ✅ **40+ species diversity** (polyculture resilience)
3. ✅ **Guild-based design** (cooperative plant communities)
4. ✅ **Monsoon timing** (June-September optimal planting window)
5. ✅ **5-year establishment plan** (from planting to independence)

**Why Phase 3 is Critical:**
- 🌳 **Trees are the backbone** - Provide fruit, nitrogen fixation, biomass, shade, windbreak
- 🌧️ **Monsoon timing matters** - Trees planted in monsoon establish deep roots with minimal irrigation
- 📅 **Get it right once** - Trees planted correctly will thrive for decades; mistakes cost years
- 💰 **Future income** - By Year 5-10, these trees produce ₹6.5-11.5 lakhs/year total revenue
- 🌍 **Ecosystem services** - Carbon sequestration, soil building, water infiltration, wildlife habitat

## PART 2: PLANTING SCHEDULE & TIMING

### Monsoon Timing is CRITICAL!

**Why Plant in Monsoon?**
- ✅ Natural rainfall (no irrigation cost)
- ✅ Trees establish deep roots (chase water table down)
- ✅ Cooler temperatures (less transplant shock)
- ✅ High humidity (reduced water stress)
- ✅ Soil moisture (easy digging, good root contact)

**Kurukshetra Monsoon Pattern:**

| Month | Rainfall | Planting Status | Success Rate |
|-------|----------|----------------|--------------|
| **June** | 50-100mm (early monsoon) | ⚠️ Can start, but risky | 60-70% |
| **July** | 150-250mm (peak!) | ✅ **OPTIMAL WINDOW** | 90-95% |
| **August** | 100-200mm (good) | ✅ **OPTIMAL WINDOW** | 85-90% |
| **September** | 50-100mm (declining) | ⚠️ Last chance | 70-80% |
| **October** | 10-30mm (monsoon end) | ❌ TOO LATE (dry season approaching) | 40-50% |

**YOUR TARGET: Plant 80% of trees in July-August (peak monsoon)**

---

### Phase 3 Master Timeline

**MAY 2026: Pre-Monsoon Preparation (3-4 weeks)**

**Week 1-2: Species Procurement**
- ☐ Visit government nurseries (Kurukshetra, Ambala) - pre-order trees
- ☐ Visit private nurseries (Panchkula, local) - select fruit tree varieties
- ☐ Order online (specialty species not available locally)
- ☐ Collect seeds/cuttings (Moringa, Gliricidia, Subabul) for DIY propagation

**Week 3: Site Preparation**
- ☐ Mark planting locations (use stakes + flags)
  - Zone 2: 110-140 trees (guild layout, spacing critical!)
  - Zone 3: 72-90 trees (orchard rows + biomass)
  - Zone 4: 200-250 trees (windbreak rows)
  - Swale berms: 180-280 trees (nitrogen fixers)
- ☐ Measure distances (tape measure, verify guild spacing)
- ☐ Document plan (take photos, create map for reference)

**Week 4: Pit Digging (Can be done before monsoon, soil is dry)**
- ☐ Dig pits for FRUIT TREES ONLY (2×2×2 ft pits, filled with compost/manure)
  - 90-114 fruit trees = 90-114 pits
  - Labor: 4 families working together = 2-3 days
- ☐ Fill pits with compost mix (50% excavated soil + 30% compost + 20% manure)
- ☐ Cover pits with boards/plastic (prevent rain filling with water)

**NOTE:** DO NOT pre-dig pits for nitrogen fixers (plant directly in smaller pits at planting time - faster, less labor)

---

**JUNE 2026: Final Preparation (2-3 weeks)**

**Week 1: Material Procurement**
- ☐ Purchase tree guards (₹30-50 each × 140-190 trees = ₹4,200-9,500 per family)
  - Options: Wire mesh cylinders (best), bamboo cages, thorny branch barriers
- ☐ Purchase stakes (bamboo poles: ₹10-20 each × 90-114 fruit trees = ₹900-2,280)
- ☐ Purchase mulch (if not using on-farm materials)
  - Need: 6 inches depth × 3 ft diameter per tree = 0.2 cu yd per tree
  - Total: 560-760 trees × 0.2 = 112-152 cu yd mulch
  - Cost (if buying straw): ₹500-800/cu yd × 112-152 = ₹56,000-1,21,600 total
  - **RECOMMENDATION:** Use on-farm materials (dried swale grasses, crop residues) - FREE!

**Week 2: Tree Collection**
- ☐ Collect pre-ordered trees from nurseries (rent vehicle if needed - ₹2,000-5,000)
- ☐ Heel-in trees (temporary planting in shaded area, keep roots moist)
- ☐ Sort trees by species and zone (organize for efficient planting)

**Week 3: Last-Minute Prep**
- ☐ Check irrigation system (drip lines to all zones functional? - from Phase 2)
- ☐ Prepare planting teams (assign zones to families, coordinate labor)
- ☐ Wait for first good rain (3-4 days of rain = soil ready for planting)

## PART 3: PLANTING TECHNIQUES (Step-by-Step)

### Technique 1: FRUIT TREE PLANTING (Mango, Guava, Jamun, etc.)

**Pit Specifications:**
- Size: 2 ft × 2 ft × 2 ft (60cm cube)
- Dug in May (pre-monsoon, soil dry and easy to dig)
- Filled with: 50% original soil + 30% compost + 20% well-rotted manure

**Planting Steps (July-August, during monsoon):**

**STEP 1: Prepare Tree**
- Remove sapling from pot/bag carefully (don't break root ball)
- If bare-root, soak roots in water 2-4 hours before planting
- Inspect roots - cut any broken/diseased roots with sharp secateurs
- Keep root ball moist (cover with wet burlap until ready to plant)

**STEP 2: Adjust Pit**
- Remove covering from pre-dug pit (board/plastic)
- Check depth: Place tree in pit, root collar should be 2-3 inches ABOVE ground level
  - Why? Tree will settle, and root collar below ground = rot risk
- If too deep: Add soil to raise level
- If too shallow: Remove some soil

**STEP 3: Planting**
- Place tree in CENTER of pit, straight vertical (use spirit level if available)
- Backfill with pit soil mix, gently firm around roots (no air pockets!)
- Build soil up to root collar (NOT above - leave exposed)
- Create water basin: Form 4-6 inch high ring of soil around tree (3 ft diameter)
  - This basin will catch rainwater and direct to roots

**STEP 4: Initial Watering**
- Fill basin with water (10-15 liters) - even in monsoon! 
- Why? Settles soil, ensures good root contact
- Let water drain completely
- Add more soil if settling revealed roots

**STEP 5: Mulching**
- Apply 6-inch layer of mulch around tree (3 ft diameter circle)
- Materials: Dried grasses, straw, crop residues, wood chips
- Keep mulch 6 inches away from trunk (create donut, not volcano!)
- Why? Prevents trunk rot, reduces weed competition, retains moisture

**STEP 6: Staking** (for trees >4 ft tall)
- Drive stake 12-18 inches into ground, 6-12 inches from trunk
- Position stake on WINDWARD side (west side in Kurukshetra - prevailing wind direction)
- Tie tree to stake with soft material (cloth strips, rubber ties - NOT wire!)
- Tie should be loose "figure-8" pattern (allows some movement, prevents rubbing)
- Check ties monthly, loosen as tree grows (remove stake after 12-18 months)

**STEP 7: Tree Guard Installation**
- Install wire mesh cylinder OR bamboo cage around tree (3-4 ft height, 2 ft diameter)
- Secure guard so it can't be pushed over by animals
- Guard protects from:
  - Chickens/ducks scratching near trunk
  - Goats browsing (if you add goats Year 2+)
  - Wild animals (deer, rabbits)
  - Strong winds (provides physical support)

**STEP 8: Labeling** (IMPORTANT!)
- Label each tree with:
  - Species name
  - Variety (for fruits)
  - Planting date
  - Source (nursery)
- Use weatherproof labels (metal tags, plastic strips with permanent marker)
- Why? Track performance, know when to expect fruiting, identify for pruning

**TIME PER TREE:** 30-45 minutes (including mulching, staking, guard)

**TEAM PRODUCTIVITY:** 4 people working together can plant 8-12 fruit trees/day (including all steps)

---

### Technique 2: NITROGEN FIXER PLANTING (Gliricidia, Subabul, Moringa, Sesbania)

**These trees are MUCH easier and faster to plant than fruit trees!**

**Pit Specifications:**
- Size: 1 ft × 1 ft × 1 ft (30cm cube)
- Dug AT PLANTING TIME (same day, no pre-digging needed)
- Compost: Add 2-3 handfuls per pit (much less than fruit trees)

**Planting Steps:**

**STEP 1: Dig Pit**
- Dig 1×1×1 ft pit at marked location
- Set soil aside
- Add 2-3 handfuls compost, mix with soil

**STEP 2: Plant Tree**
- Place sapling in pit (root collar at ground level, NOT raised like fruit trees)
- Backfill, firm soil
- Water lightly (5 liters)

**STEP 3: Mulch**
- Apply 4-inch mulch layer (2 ft diameter circle)
- Nitrogen fixers are HARDY - don't need as much pampering as fruit trees

**STEP 4: Skip Staking & Guards** (Usually)
- Nitrogen fixers are fast-growing, resilient
- Only stake if >6 ft tall
- Only guard if animals are a problem (if chickens/ducks destroying, add simple barriers)

**TIME PER TREE:** 10-15 minutes

**TEAM PRODUCTIVITY:** 4 people can plant 40-60 nitrogen fixers/day

---

### Technique 3: STEM CUTTING PLANTING (Gliricidia, Moringa - Direct Stick Method)

**This is FASTEST method - for mature Gliricidia/Moringa only**

**Cutting Specifications:**
- Length: 2-4 ft (60-120cm)
- Diameter: 2-4 inches (thick cuttings root better)
- Source: Healthy, disease-free mature tree (>2 years old)
- Cut type: Hardwood (woody stem, not soft green branch)

**Planting Steps:**

**STEP 1: Prepare Cutting**
- Cut stem at 45° angle (top and bottom) with sharp saw/machete
- Remove all leaves (except top 2-3 if soft tip present)
- Cutting can be planted IMMEDIATELY (no rooting hormone needed for Gliricidia/Moringa)

**STEP 2: Plant Cutting**
- Dig hole 12-18 inches deep (use crowbar or pointed stick in monsoon soft soil)
- Insert cutting 12-18 inches deep (bottom end down! - check cut angle)
- Firm soil around cutting (must be stable, not wobbly)
- Water lightly (3-5 liters)

**STEP 3: Mulch**
- Apply 2-4 inch mulch (keep mulch 3 inches from cutting stem)

**STEP 4: Wait**
- Roots form in 2-4 weeks (cutting may look dead - DON'T DISTURB!)
- New shoots emerge from top in 4-8 weeks
- Success rate: 70-90% (very high for Gliricidia/Moringa)

**TIME PER CUTTING:** 5 minutes!

**TEAM PRODUCTIVITY:** 4 people can plant 100-150 cuttings/day

**COST:** FREE (if source trees available) vs ₹20-40/sapling

**RECOMMENDATION:** Use cutting method for 50% of Gliricidia/Moringa (saves ₹2,000-5,000 per family!)

---

### Technique 4: SEED PLANTING (Subabul, Neem, Tamarind - Budget Option)

**For Maximum Savings:**

**Seed Specifications:**
- Source: Collect from mature trees (local trees = adapted to your climate)
- Timing: Collect seeds when pods/fruits mature (varies by species)
- Storage: Store in cool, dry place until planting

**Pre-Treatment (Species-Specific):**

**Subabul:**
- Soak seeds in hot water (80°C) for 5 minutes
- Let cool, soak 12 hours in room-temp water
- This breaks seed coat dormancy

**Neem:**
- Remove flesh from fruit, wash seeds
- No pre-treatment needed (plant fresh)

**Moringa:**
- No pre-treatment (direct sow)

**Planting Steps:**

**OPTION A: Direct Sowing** (Plant seeds in final location)
- Dig 6-inch deep hole at planting location
- Plant 2-3 seeds per hole (insurance against low germination)
- Cover with 1-2 inches soil
- Water lightly
- Thin to 1 strongest seedling after 4-6 weeks

**OPTION B: Nursery Bed** (Grow seedlings first, transplant later - BETTER)
- Create nursery bed (4×8 ft raised bed, well-draining soil)
- Plant seeds 3-4 inches apart, 1-2 inches deep
- Water daily
- Transplant to final location when seedlings are 8-12 inches tall (8-12 weeks)
- Why better? Higher survival rate, easier to care for when small

**TIME PER SEED:** 2-3 minutes (direct sow) OR 20-30 minutes (transplant)

**GERMINATION TIME:** 2-4 weeks (varies by species)

**SUCCESS RATE:** 60-80% (lower than buying saplings, but FREE!)

**RECOMMENDATION:** Use seed method for "fill-in" trees (swale berms, Zone 4 timber) where some failure is acceptable

---

## PART 4: ESTABLISHMENT CARE (Year 1-5)

### Year 1: SURVIVAL MODE (June 2026-May 2027)

**Goal:** Keep 85-90% of trees alive through first dry season

---

**WATERING SCHEDULE:**

**Monsoon (July-September):**
- Natural rainfall usually sufficient
- ONLY water if 5+ days without rain
- Check soil moisture: Dig 3-4 inches down, should be damp
- If dry: Water fruit trees (10-15 liters per tree)
- Nitrogen fixers: Usually don't need supplemental water (very hardy)

**Post-Monsoon (October-November):**
- Water 1x/week (all trees)
- Fruit trees: 15-20 liters per tree
- Nitrogen fixers: 10 liters per tree
- Method: Use drip irrigation (already installed in Phase 2) OR hand watering

**Dry Season (December-May) - CRITICAL PERIOD!**
- **December-February (mild):** Water 1x/week
- **March-May (hot):** Water 2x/week (every 3-4 days)
- Fruit trees: 20-30 liters per tree per watering
- Nitrogen fixers: 15-20 liters per tree
- Signs of water stress: Wilting leaves, leaf drop, yellowing
- **DON'T overwater!** Check soil before each watering

**Total Water Need (Year 1):**
- Per fruit tree: ~2,500-3,500 liters/year
- Per nitrogen fixer: ~1,500-2,500 liters/year
- 560-760 trees × average 2,000 liters = 1,120,000-1,520,000 liters/year
- = 1,120-1,520 cubic meters
- Your drip irrigation system capacity: ADEQUATE (designed for this load)

---

**MULCHING:**

**Initial Mulch (September 2026):**
- 6-inch depth, 3 ft diameter per tree
- Material: Dried grasses, straw, crop residues

**Replenish Schedule:**
- **December:** Check mulch, add 2-4 inches if eroded
- **April:** Major refresh (add 4-6 inches before summer heat)
- **Monsoon (July-August):** Mulch may be washed away by heavy rain - refresh in September

**Total Mulch Needed (Year 1):**
- Initial: 112-152 cubic yards
- Replenish (2x): 75-100 cubic yards each = 150-200 cubic yards
- **TOTAL:** 262-352 cubic yards
- **Source:** On-farm (Zone 1 crop residues, Zone 2-3 grass clippings, coppiced nitrogen fixer leaves) = FREE!
- If buying: ₹500-800/cu yd × 262-352 = ₹1,31,000-2,81,600 total (₹32,750-70,400 per family) - EXPENSIVE!

**RECOMMENDATION:** Use 100% on-farm mulch materials (save ₹1.3-2.8 lakhs total!)

---

**WEEDING:**

**Frequency:**
- **Months 1-3 (July-September):** Weekly (weeds grow FAST in monsoon)
- **Months 4-6 (October-December):** Every 2 weeks
- **Months 7-12 (January-May):** Monthly (dry season, slower weed growth)

**Method:**
- Hand pull weeds (DON'T use hoe near young trees - risk root damage)
- Pull when soil is moist (easier, gets roots)
- Leave pulled weeds as mulch (chop-and-drop)

**Weed Circle:**
- Keep 3 ft diameter circle around each tree weed-free
- Why? Weeds compete for water/nutrients (critical in Year 1)
- After Year 2-3, can allow ground cover plants (cowpea, sweet potato) in this zone

**Labor:**
- Per tree: 5-10 minutes per weeding session
- 560-760 trees × 8 minutes average × 30 weeding sessions (Year 1) = 2,240-3,040 hours total
- = 560-760 hours per family (assuming 4 families share equally)
- = 10-15 hours/week per family (Year 1 only - reduces Year 2+)

**THIS IS WHY MULCHING IS CRITICAL!** 6-inch mulch reduces weeding by 70-80%

---

**PEST & DISEASE MONITORING:**

**Weekly Inspection (Walk all trees):**
- Check leaves: Holes, discoloration, spots?
- Check stems: Boring holes, sap oozing, cracks?
- Check ground: Ants (indicate aphids), caterpillars, beetle grubs?

**Common Pests (Year 1):**

**1. Caterpillars/Leaf Eaters:**
- Damage: Holes in leaves, defoliation
- Control: Hand-pick (if small numbers) OR neem oil spray (5ml/liter water, spray every 7-10 days)

**2. Aphids:**
- Damage: Curled leaves, sticky honeydew, stunted growth
- Control: Spray with water jet (dislodges aphids) OR neem oil spray

**3. Termites:**
- Damage: Hollow stems, sudden wilting, tree death
- Prevention: Keep mulch 6 inches from trunk (termites attracted to wood-on-trunk contact)
- Control (if found): Neem oil drench around base OR remove infected mulch, add wood ash

**4. Borers:**
- Damage: Small holes in trunk, sawdust piles, dying branches
- Control: Physically remove larvae with wire (insert in hole, hook larvae out) OR inject neem oil in hole

**Organic Pest Control Kit (Keep on Hand):**
- Neem oil: 5 liters (₹500-1,000)
- Spray bottles: 4-5 (₹100-200)
- Pruning shears: 4 (₹200-400)
- Gloves: 8 pairs (₹400-800)
- **Total:** ₹1,200-2,400 (₹300-600 per family)

---

**PRUNING (Year 1):**

**Goals:**
- Train fruit trees to open center shape (allows light penetration, air circulation)
- Remove dead/diseased branches
- Remove suckers (shoots from rootstock below graft)

**When to Prune:**
- **Fruit trees:** December-January (after leaf drop, before new growth)
- **Nitrogen fixers:** NO pruning Year 1 (let grow vigorously to establish)

**How to Prune (Fruit Trees):**
- Remove competing central leaders (keep 1 strong central trunk)
- Remove branches crossing/rubbing (prevents wounds, disease entry)
- Remove lower branches (first 2-3 ft from ground - keeps fruit off ground, easier to harvest)
- Cut at 45° angle just above bud (promotes healing, prevents rot)
- Disinfect shears between trees (dip in 10% bleach solution - prevents disease spread)

**Labor:** 15-30 minutes per fruit tree × 90-114 trees = 23-57 hours total (6-14 hours per family)

---

**FERTILIZATION (Year 1):**

**Fruit Trees:**
- **Month 3 (September):** Top-dress with compost (5-10 kg per tree)
  - Spread in circle around tree, 6-12 inches from trunk
  - Scratch into top 2-3 inches of soil
  - Water in
- **Month 9 (March):** Repeat (5-10 kg compost per tree)

**Nitrogen Fixers:**
- **NO fertilization needed!** (they make their own nitrogen)
- Exception: If growth is very slow (<6 inches/year), add 2-3 kg compost (may indicate poor soil)

**Compost Needed (Year 1):**
- Fruit trees: 90-114 trees × 10 kg average × 2 applications = 1,800-2,280 kg = 1.8-2.3 tons
- Your 3-bay compost system (from Phase 2) produces: 10-15 cubic yards/year = 5-7.5 tons
- **Compost is SUFFICIENT** (use 30-40% for tree fertilization, rest for Zone 1 gardens)

---

### Year 2: ESTABLISHMENT (June 2027-May 2028)

**Goal:** Reduce inputs, encourage independence

---

**WATERING SCHEDULE (Reduced from Year 1):**

**Monsoon (July-September):**
- NO watering needed (unless extreme drought)

**Post-Monsoon (October-November):**
- Water every 10-14 days (reduce from weekly)

**Dry Season (December-May):**
- **December-February:** Water every 10-14 days
- **March-May:** Water weekly (reduce from 2x/week Year 1)
- Fruit trees: 20-25 liters per watering
- Nitrogen fixers: 10-15 liters (many won't need water if well-established)

**Total Water Need (Year 2):** 40-50% reduction from Year 1

---

**COPPICING (First Harvest!):**

**Nitrogen Fixers (June-July Year 2, after monsoon starts):**
- Gliricidia, Subabul, Moringa, Sesbania: Cut to 3-4 ft height
- Use biomass for:
  - Mulch (50%): Chop leaves/stems, spread around fruit trees
  - Compost (40%): Add to compost system
  - Fodder (10%): If you added goats Year 2
- **Yield:** 15-25 kg fresh biomass per tree × 430-590 trees = 6,450-14,750 kg = 6.5-14.75 tons!
  - This is 2X Year 1 biomass (trees now established, vigorous regrowth)

**Coppicing Schedule:**
- Year 2: Cut once (June-July)
- Year 3: Cut twice (March + August)
- Year 4+: Cut 3-4x per year (every 3-4 months) = full production

---

**PRUNING:**

**Fruit Trees:**
- **December-January:** Structural pruning (continue shaping tree)
- **March:** Light pruning (remove dead/diseased branches only)

**Nitrogen Fixers:**
- Coppicing (above) replaces pruning

---

**MULCHING:**

- Reduce frequency to 2x/year (September + April)
- Mulch depth: Can reduce to 4 inches (trees more established)
- Source: Now have coppiced nitrogen fixer biomass (6-15 tons!) - use this!

---

**PEST/DISEASE:**

- Continue weekly inspections
- Guild diversity (companion plants) starting to provide pest control (marigolds, curry leaf, lemongrass attracting beneficial insects)
- Neem spray only if major outbreak (should be less frequent than Year 1)

---

**FERTILIZATION:**

- Fruit trees: Compost 2x/year (September + March), same as Year 1
- Nitrogen fixers: Still none needed

---

**FIRST FRUITS!** 🎉

**Species fruiting in Year 2-3:**
- Pomegranate: Year 2 (first small harvest)
- Fig: Year 2-3
- Ber: Year 3
- Guava: Year 3-4

**Expected yields (Year 2-3):**
- 5-20% of mature yield (trees still small)
- Pomegranate: 5-15 fruits per tree
- Fig: 10-30 fruits per tree
- Total revenue: ₹5,000-15,000 (all 4 families) - mostly novelty, not significant income yet

---

### Year 3: ACCELERATING GROWTH (June 2028-May 2029)

**Goal:** Trees becoming more independent, first significant harvests

---

**WATERING:**

**Fruit Trees:**
- Monsoon: No watering
- Post-monsoon: No watering (trees have deep roots now)
- Dry season: Water monthly (only during extreme heat March-May)

**Nitrogen Fixers:**
- NO WATERING YEAR 3+ (fully drought-adapted)

**Total water need:** 70-80% reduction from Year 1!

---

**COPPICING:**

- Nitrogen fixers: Cut 3x/year (March, July, October)
- Full biomass production: 15-25 kg per tree per cycle × 3 cycles = 45-75 kg per tree per year
- Total: 430-590 trees × 60 kg average = 25,800-35,400 kg = 26-35 tons/year!
- **This is 4-5X Year 1 biomass** (coppice system in full swing)

**Uses:**
- Mulch: 40% (10-14 tons)
- Compost: 40% (10-14 tons)
- Fodder: 20% (5-7 tons) - if goats

---

**PRUNING:**

- Fruit trees: Annual pruning only (December-January), 15-20 minutes per tree
- Much lighter than Year 1-2 (basic structural pruning complete)

---

**PEST/DISEASE:**

- Weekly inspections can reduce to bi-weekly (every 2 weeks)
- Guild ecosystem maturing (beneficial insects establishing populations)
- Neem spray: Rare (only if specific outbreak)

---

**FERTILIZATION:**

- Fruit trees: Reduce to 1x/year (September post-monsoon compost top-dress)
- 5-10 kg per tree (same amount, but less frequent)
- Nitrogen from coppiced nitrogen fixers (chop-and-drop around fruit trees) provides continuous fertility

---

**HARVESTS (Year 3-4):**

**Species fruiting:**
- Pomegranate: Full production (20-40 fruits per tree × 16-20 trees = 320-800 fruits)
- Fig: Good production (50-100 fruits per tree × 6-8 trees = 300-800 fruits)
- Ber: First harvest (10-30 kg per tree × 10-14 trees = 100-420 kg)
- Guava: First significant harvest (10-40 kg per tree × 16-20 trees = 160-800 kg)

**Revenue (Year 3):**
- Pomegranate: 320-800 fruits × ₹20-30/fruit = ₹6,400-24,000
- Fig: 300-800 fruits × ₹10-15/fruit = ₹3,000-12,000
- Ber: 100-420 kg × ₹30-50/kg = ₹3,000-21,000
- Guava: 160-800 kg × ₹20-40/kg = ₹3,200-32,000
- **TOTAL:** ₹15,600-89,000 (₹3,900-22,250 per family)

**FIRST REAL INCOME FROM TREES!** 🎉

---

### Year 4: MATURITY APPROACHING (June 2029-May 2030)

## PART 5: GUILD PLANTING LAYOUTS

### Guild Spacing Guide (Critical for Success!)

**NEVER plant trees too close!** Crowding = competition = poor growth = lower yields

---

**MANGO GUILD Spacing (60 ft diameter total):**

- Comfrey (6-8 ft, 4 plants at cardinal directions)
- Marigold (4-6 ft, 8-12 plants inner ring)
- Lemongrass (10-12 ft, 3 clumps scattered)

Ground cover (3-8 ft from mango):
- Cowpea (broadcast seed, 3-8 ft)
- Sweet potato (6-8 cuttings, 4-8 ft)
- Turmeric/Ginger (8-12 rhizomes, 5-8 ft)
```

**Critical Measurements:**
- Mango to Mango: 25-30 ft (MINIMUM - don't plant closer!)
- Mango to Gliricidia: 20-25 ft
- Mango to Curry Leaf: 12-15 ft
- Mango to Pigeon Pea: 8-10 ft
- Mango to Comfrey: 6-8 ft
- Mango to Marigold: 4-6 ft
- Mango to ground covers: 3-8 ft

---

**GUAVA GUILD Spacing (40 ft diameter total):**

Guava is smaller than mango, so guild is more compact

- Marigold (3-5 ft, 6-8 plants)
- Cowpea ground cover (2-6 ft)
```

**Guava to Guava: 15-20 ft minimum**

---

**JAMUN GUILD Spacing (60 ft diameter, similar to Mango):**

Jamun is large tree like mango, needs similar spacing

```
Layout: Same as Mango guild
Jamun to Jamun: 25-30 ft minimum
Understory: Drought-resistant species (Jamun tolerates dry conditions)
```

---

**SWALE BERM Spacing:**

```
SWALE (209 ft length, running East-West)

BERM (south side of swale):
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  G      S      M      S      G      M      S    │
│ (10')  (10')  (12')  (10')  (10')  (12')  (10') │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

G = Gliricidia (10-12 ft spacing)
S = Subabul (10-12 ft spacing)
M = Moringa (10-12 ft spacing)

Staggered pattern (not straight line):
- Prevents wind tunnel effect
- Creates pockets for guilds
- Better aesthetics

## PART 6: TROUBLESHOOTING & COMMON MISTAKES

### Mistake 1: **Planting Too Close** ❌

**Problem:**
- Trees crowded, compete for light/water/nutrients
- Lower yields, increased disease (poor air circulation)
- Difficult to access for harvest/pruning

**Solution:**
- Follow spacing guidelines (above)
- If you discover trees too close in Year 1-2: TRANSPLANT or REMOVE weaker tree
  - Better to sacrifice 1 tree than have 2 weak trees

**How to Check:** 
- Mature spread of mango: 30-40 ft diameter
- At maturity, neighboring trees should BARELY touch (10-20% canopy overlap = okay)
- If you expect 50%+ overlap: TOO CLOSE

---

### Mistake 2: **Planting Too Deep** ❌

**Problem:**
- Root collar buried below soil
- Results in: Root rot, stunted growth, eventual death

**Symptoms:**
- Tree looks stunted, yellowing leaves
- Inspection reveals trunk buried 4-6 inches below soil

**Solution (If caught early):**
- Carefully excavate soil around trunk (dig down 12 inches in 3 ft circle)
- Expose root flare (point where roots meet trunk - should be visible)
- Remove soil until root flare is 2-3 inches ABOVE ground level
- Do NOT disturb roots during excavation

**Prevention:**
- Always plant with root collar 2-3 inches ABOVE ground level
- Account for settling (tree will sink 1-2 inches as soil settles)

---

### Mistake 3: **Overwatering** ❌

**Problem:**
- Waterlogged soil = root suffocation = root rot
- Especially common in heavy clay soil or poor-drainage areas

**Symptoms:**
- Yellowing leaves (starts with older leaves)
- Wilting despite wet soil (roots damaged, can't absorb water)
- Fungal growth around base, foul smell from soil

**Solution:**
- STOP watering immediately
- Improve drainage:
  - Dig channels to allow water to drain away
  - Add sand/gravel to soil around tree (improves drainage)
  - Plant on mound (6-12 inches raised above grade)
- Prune diseased roots (if root rot advanced)

**Prevention:**
- Check soil before watering (dig 3-4 inches, should be barely moist, not wet)
- In monsoon, usually NO supplemental watering needed
- Swale system should prevent waterlogging (water infiltrates through berm)

---

### Mistake 4: **Planting Wrong Season** ❌

**Problem:**
- Planting in dry season (November-May) = very low survival rate
- Tree has no time to establish roots before extreme summer heat

**If You MUST Plant in Dry Season:**
- Only for potted saplings (bare-root = certain death)
- Water daily for first 2 weeks, then every 2-3 days for 3 months
- Mulch heavily (8-10 inches)
- Provide 50% shade cloth for first 2 months
- Expect 50-70% survival vs 85-95% monsoon planting

**BEST PRACTICE:** Wait for monsoon. It's worth it!

---

### Mistake 5: **No Mulch** ❌

**Problem:**
- Soil dries out rapidly (especially sandy loam Kurukshetra soil)
- Weed competition extreme
- Soil temperature fluctuates (stresses roots)

**Impact on Survival:**
- Mulched trees: 85-95% survival
- Non-mulched trees: 50-70% survival (in Kurukshetra climate)

**Solution:**
- Mulch EVERY tree, 6-inch depth minimum
- Source: On-farm materials (free!) OR purchase straw (expensive)
- Replenish 2-3x/year (mulch breaks down = good for soil, but needs replacement)

---

### Mistake 6: **Ignoring Pests Early** ❌

**Problem:**
- Small pest problem in Week 1-2 becomes major outbreak by Month 2-3
- Can kill tree or severely stunt growth

**Examples:**
- Termites: Kill 50% of unprotected saplings in some areas
- Borers: Can kill tree in 4-6 months if untreated
- Caterpillars: Can defoliate entire young tree in 1-2 weeks

**Solution:**
- Weekly inspections (non-negotiable!)
- Intervene EARLY (1 caterpillar = hand-pick; 100 caterpillars = spray)
- Keep neem oil on hand (5 liters per family minimum)

---

### Mistake 7: **Wrong Variety for Soil** ❌

**Problem:**
- Planted acid-loving varieties (Alphonso mango, citrus) in alkaline Kurukshetra soil
- Trees survive but never thrive, minimal fruiting

**Symptoms:**
- Yellowing leaves (chlorosis) despite fertilization - iron deficiency in alkaline soil
- Slow growth (<6 inches/year)
- Poor fruit set

**Solution (If caught early):**
- Grafting: Cut tree to 18 inches, graft alkaline-tolerant variety
- Soil amendment: Sulfur + iron chelate (lowers pH temporarily, but expensive and temporary)

**Prevention:**
- ONLY plant varieties confirmed for pH 7.5-8.5 (see Variety Selection section above)
- When in doubt, ASK nursery: "Does this variety tolerate alkaline soil?"

### Non-Monetary Benefits (Hard to Quantify!)

**Ecosystem Services:**
- Carbon sequestration: 562-760 trees × 20 kg CO₂/tree/year average = 11,240-15,200 kg CO₂/year
- Groundwater recharge: 562-760 trees × 500 liters infiltration/tree/year = 281,000-380,000 liters/year
- Soil building: 200-300 kg N/year from nitrogen fixers = ₹4,000-6,000/year fertilizer value
- Biodiversity: Habitat for birds, beneficial insects, pollinators

**Food Security:**
- Fresh fruit year-round (different species ripen different months)
- Reduces grocery costs: ₹20,000-40,000/family/year (fruit purchases avoided)

**Quality of Life:**
- Shade (reduces property temperature 3-5°C)
- Beauty (flowering trees, birds, butterflies)
- Education (children learn about nature, agriculture, seasons)
- Legacy (trees outlive us - gift to future generations)

### Your Action Items (Start NOW - May 2026):

**IMMEDIATE (May 2026):**

1. ☐ **Finalize species list** (use this document as template, adjust based on family preferences)
2. ☐ **Visit nurseries** (government + private, pre-order trees for June-July delivery)
3. ☐ **Procure planting materials** (tree guards, stakes, mulch sources identified)
4. ☐ **Assign zones to families** (who manages Zone 2? Zone 3? Zone 4? Swale berms?)
5. ☐ **Create planting calendar** (specific dates based on weather forecast)

**JUNE 2026:**

6. ☐ **Collect all trees** (nurseries, online orders, DIY propagation)
7. ☐ **Prepare sites** (mark locations, dig fruit tree pits)
8. ☐ **Form planting teams** (4 families working together = efficient!)
9. ☐ **Watch weather** (wait for first sustained rains, 3-4 days of good rain)

**JULY-AUGUST 2026:**

10. ☐ **PLANT MONSOON BLITZ!** (80% of trees in this 8-week window)
11. ☐ **Document everything** (photos, maps, planting dates, species locations)
12. ☐ **Install protection** (guards, stakes, mulch - immediately after planting)

**SEPTEMBER-NOVEMBER 2026:**

13. ☐ **Finish remaining 20%** (catch-up planting, replacements)
14. ☐ **Intensive monitoring** (weekly inspections, immediate intervention for issues)
15. ☐ **Celebrate Phase 3 completion!** (you've planted a food forest for 100 years!)

---

### Integration with Other Phases:

**Phase 1 (Earthworks) + Phase 2 (Infrastructure) MUST be complete before Phase 3:**
- ✅ Swales dug and functional (trees depend on swale water infiltration)
- ✅ Pond excavated (Zone 2B trees need pond microclimate)
- ✅ Drip irrigation installed (trees need supplemental water Years 1-3)
- ✅ Access paths established (need to reach all planting locations)

**Phase 3 enables Phase 4 (Animal Introduction):**
- ✅ Fruit trees provide shade for chickens/ducks
- ✅ Nitrogen fixers provide fodder (if goats added)
- ✅ Guild ground covers (cowpea, sweet potato) provide forage
- ✅ Food forest structure creates pest habitat (beneficial insects eat pests that affect animals)

---

### Final Words:

**"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second-best time is NOW."** - Chinese Proverb

**Your 562-760 trees, planted in July-August 2026, will be producing abundant fruit by 2031-2036 and continue for 50-100+ years.**

**This is your legacy. Plant well.** 🌳✨
