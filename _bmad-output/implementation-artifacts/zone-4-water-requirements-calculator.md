## SEASONAL WATER CALCULATIONS (Year 1)

### Season 1: MONSOON (July-Sept, 12 weeks)

**Rainfall:** 380-650mm (average: 500mm over 3 months)

**Natural Irrigation:**
- 500mm rainfall = 500 liters per sq meter
- Zone 4 area: 1.06 acres = 4,290 sq meters

### Water Source Strategy (Recommended)

**Multi-Source Approach:**

**July-Sept (Monsoon):**
- **Primary:** Swale 3 overflow (FREE, abundant)
- **Backup:** Tubewell (if Swale 3 insufficient)
- **Irrigation:** Minimal (supplemental only)

**Oct-Dec (Post-Monsoon):**
- **Primary:** Swale 3 residual + Pond (both recharged from monsoon)
- **Backup:** Tubewell (if dry spell)
- **Irrigation:** Moderate (weekly)

**Jan-March (Winter):**
- **Primary:** Tubewell (Swale 3 and Pond may be low)
- **Backup:** Pond (if still has water)
- **Irrigation:** Low (bi-weekly)

**April-June (Summer - CRITICAL!):**
- **Primary:** Tubewell (ONLY reliable source)
- **Backup:** NONE (Swale 3 and Pond likely dry)
- **Irrigation:** HIGH (weekly or 2x weekly in May-June)

**Key Insight:** Tubewell is ESSENTIAL for April-June survival (no alternative!)

## WATER STORAGE & BUFFER CAPACITY

### Storage Tank System (Recommended)

**Purpose:**
- Buffer for dry spells (if tubewell fails, power outage)
- Gravity-fed delivery (reduce pumping costs)
- Emergency reserve (1-2 weeks water for critical trees)

**Tank Specifications:**

**Option A: 2 x 2,000 Liter Tanks (RECOMMENDED)**
- **Capacity:** 4,000 liters total
- **Buffer:** 1-2 days full irrigation (Year 1) OR 1 week emergency (high-value Row 1 only)
- **Location:** Elevated platform (10 ft above ground) at Zone 4 western end
- **Cost:** 2 x ₹8,000-12,000 = ₹16,000-24,000 (tanks) + ₹5,000-10,000 (platform) = ₹21,000-34,000

**Option B: 1 x 5,000 Liter Tank**
- **Capacity:** 5,000 liters
- **Buffer:** 1-2 days full irrigation
- **Cost:** ₹15,000-20,000 (tank) + ₹8,000-12,000 (platform) = ₹23,000-32,000

**Delivery:**
- Gravity-fed (tank elevated 10 ft above Zone 4)
- No pumping cost (when using stored water)
- **Pressure:** 10 ft = ~0.3 bar (sufficient for drip system)

**Filling:**
- Tubewell pump → Tank (automated float valve)
- Pump runs 2-3 hours/day (fills 4,000 liters)
- Tank distributes water via gravity (rest of day)

**Benefits:**
- Reduces pump running time (electricity savings)
- Provides buffer (power outage, pump failure)
- Gravity-fed drip (more consistent pressure)

### Emergency Water Protocol (Drought/Tubewell Failure)

**IF Tubewell Fails OR Extreme Drought:**

**Priority Irrigation (Save highest-value trees FIRST):**

**Tier 1 (Absolute Priority - 18 trees):**
- ALL Shisham (18 trees) = high-value timber
- Water: 30-40 liters per tree, every 5-7 days
- Total: 540-720 liters/week
- **Can be hand-delivered (buckets from pond/any source)**

**Tier 2 (High Priority - 19 trees):**
- Grafted Mango (5 trees)
- Jamun (5 trees)
- Neem (9 trees)
- Water: 20-30 liters per tree, every 7-10 days
- Total: 380-570 liters/week

**Tier 3 (Moderate Priority - 87 trees):**
- Row 3 Bamboo (45 clumps) + Moringa (22 trees)
- Water: 15-25 liters per plant, every 10-14 days
- Total (bi-weekly): 1,305-2,175 liters

**Tier 4 (Low Priority - 192 trees):**
- Row 2 nitrogen fixers (VERY drought-tolerant) + Row 4 shrubs (Ber, Karonda)
- Water: SKIP irrigation (accept 20-30% mortality, these species can regrow)

**Total Emergency Irrigation (Tier 1-3):**
- Weekly: 920-1,290 liters (vs. 7,085-10,475 normal)
- **REDUCTION:** 85-88% less water (focuses on high-value only)

**Emergency Water Sources:**
- Tank reserve: 4,000 liters (3-4 weeks for Tier 1-2)
- Pond (if any water): Hand-bucket delivery
- Purchase water tanker: ₹500-1,000 per 5,000 liters (extreme last resort)
- Neighbor's tubewell: Goodwill/payment

## WATER EFFICIENCY TIPS (Maximize Every Drop!)

### Soil Water Retention Strategies

**1. Mulching (CRITICAL!):**
- **Thickness:** 4-6 inches around each tree
- **Material:** Straw, dried leaves, wood chips, grass clippings
- **Effect:** 40-50% reduction in evaporation
- **Cost:** ₹0-5,000 (free if collected on-farm, purchase if needed)
- **Replenish:** 2x per year (monsoon, spring)

**2. Compost Addition (Done in pit preparation):**
- **Organic matter:** 20-30% compost in pits
- **Effect:** 3-5x better water retention vs. alkaline soil alone
- **Benefit:** Less frequent watering needed

**3. Biochar (Optional, Advanced):**
- **Application:** 10-20% biochar in pits (if available)
- **Effect:** 2-3x water holding capacity
- **Cost:** ₹5,000-10,000 for 316 pits (if purchased)
- **DIY:** Make biochar from farm prunings (free, labor-intensive)

**4. Cover Crops (Row 5 Ground Layer):**
- **Effect:** Living mulch, prevents soil evaporation
- **Species:** Native grasses, wildflowers (planted in Row 5)
- **Benefit:** Reduces water need for trees (microclimate effect)

---

### Watering Technique Optimization

**1. Deep Watering (Not Frequent Shallow):**
- **Method:** 20-30 liters SLOW delivery (over 30-60 min, drip ideal)
- **Effect:** Encourages DEEP roots (drought-resistant trees)
- **Avoid:** Frequent light watering (encourages shallow roots, water stress)

**2. Watering Basin (Critical for Manual):**
- **Design:** 3 ft diameter, 3-4 inch deep rim around each tree
- **Effect:** Holds water (prevents runoff), directs to roots
- **Maintenance:** Re-form basin after rain (erosion flattens rim)

**3. Timing (Reduce Evaporation):**
- **BEST:** Early morning (6-9 AM) - cool, low evaporation, trees hydrated for day
- **AVOID:** Midday (10 AM-4 PM) - 30-50% evaporation loss!
- **OK:** Evening (5-7 PM) - but wet foliage overnight = fungal risk

**4. Targeted Watering (Drip Root Zone):**
- **Drip emitters:** 12-18 inches from trunk (root zone)
- **Avoid:** Wetting trunk (rot risk), wetting leaves (fungal disease)

---

### Monitoring Soil Moisture (Avoid Over/Under-Watering)

**Simple Hand-Feel Test:**
- **Dig 6 inches** next to tree (outside watering basin)
- **Squeeze soil:**
  - **Too DRY:** Crumbles, dusty (WATER IMMEDIATELY!)
  - **PERFECT:** Forms ball, slightly moist, doesn't drip (IDEAL)
  - **Too WET:** Muddy, water drips from fist (SKIP watering, wait 3-5 days)

**Frequency:**
- Check 5-10 random trees weekly (represent Row 1-4)
- Adjust watering schedule based on results

**Soil Moisture Meter (Optional, ₹500-1,500):**
- Insert probe 6-12 inches deep
- Reads: DRY / MOIST / WET
- More accurate than hand-feel

- Install drip in Year 2 (₹33,000-53,000)
- Benefit: 70% water savings, 90% labor savings

**Monitor Tree Growth:**
- Measure height/girth annually
- Adjust watering if growth stunted (under-watering) or excessive (over-watering)

---

### Year 4+ Goal (Self-Sufficient Zone 4)

**Target:** ZERO regular irrigation (only extreme drought years)

**Keys to Success:**
- Deep-rooted trees (access subsoil moisture)
- Drought-adapted species (Ber, Khejri, Neem, Babul naturally survive)
- Swale 3 infiltration (raises water table 1-3 ft by Year 5-10)
- Mulch + organic matter (soil retains moisture)

**If Achieved:**
- **Water cost:** ₹0 (Year 4+)
- **Labor:** 0-5 hours/year (emergency only)
- **Zone 4 = Self-Sufficient!** ✅
