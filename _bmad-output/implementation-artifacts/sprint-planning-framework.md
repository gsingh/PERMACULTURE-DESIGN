## 🌦️ SEASONAL ADAPTATIONS

### Monsoon Season (July-September)
- **Planting:** Maximum tree planting (natural irrigation)
- **Earthworks:** Pause excavation (mud issues)
- **Construction:** Focus on roofing, avoid masonry
- **Strategy:** Front-load planting sprints, back-load infrastructure

### Winter Season (October-February)
- **Planting:** Kitchen gardens, cool-season crops
- **Construction:** Ideal for masonry, concrete work
- **Animals:** Introduce chickens/ducks (cooler stress)
- **Strategy:** Heavy infrastructure work

### Summer Season (March-June)
- **Earthworks:** Prime time for excavation (dry soil)
- **Planting:** Pre-monsoon tree prep (pit digging)
- **Irrigation:** Install systems before monsoon
- **Strategy:** Front-load earthworks and irrigation

## 🚨 RISK MANAGEMENT

### Common Sprint Blockers

**1. Weather Delays**
- **Risk:** Monsoon extends, winter construction impossible
- **Mitigation:** 2-week buffer in schedule, alternate indoor tasks

**2. Contractor No-Shows**
- **Risk:** Excavator/mason unavailable
- **Mitigation:** Book 4-6 weeks in advance, backup vendors

**3. Budget Overruns**
- **Risk:** Material costs spike mid-project
- **Mitigation:** Purchase critical materials upfront, 15% contingency

**4. Family Labor Shortage**
- **Risk:** Illness, emergency, burnout
- **Mitigation:** 3-family minimum rule (1 family off per sprint OK)

**5. Supply Chain Issues**
- **Risk:** Trees, materials unavailable
- **Mitigation:** Order 1 sprint ahead, local suppliers prioritized
