## 🔍 QUICK ASSESSMENT CHECKLIST

### Visit 1: Basic Information (30 minutes)

#### 1. Pump Motor Nameplate Data
**Location:** On the motor casing (usually near top of tubewell)

**Record:**
- [ ] **Motor HP:** _____ HP (typically 3, 5, 7.5, or 10 HP for agricultural)
- [ ] **Phase:** Single / Three Phase (circle one)
- [ ] **Voltage:** _____ V (typically 230V single, 440V three-phase)
- [ ] **Brand/Model:** ________________
- [ ] **Age/Install Date:** _____ (if visible)

**Why Critical:** Determines pumping capacity and electricity requirements

---

#### 2. Current Irrigation Pattern Observation

**When pump is running, observe:**
- [ ] **Outlet pipe diameter:** _____ inch (measure with tape or estimate)
- [ ] **Pressure at outlet:** Strong / Medium / Weak (visual assessment)
- [ ] **Water clarity:** Clear / Slightly turbid / Muddy
- [ ] **Flow pattern:** Steady / Pulsing / Variable

**Field Coverage:**
- [ ] **Area currently watered:** _____ acres (estimate or ask farmer)
- [ ] **Irrigation method:** Flood / Furrow / Sprinkler / Drip
- [ ] **Pumping hours per day:** _____ hours (ask farmer)
- [ ] **Frequency:** Daily / Every 2-3 days / Weekly

**Why Critical:** Shows current system capacity and gives baseline for your needs

---

#### 3. Simple Flow Rate Test (If Possible)

**Method 1: Bucket Test (Most Accurate)**
1. Get a large bucket (10-20 liter capacity, measure volume)
2. When pump is running, fill bucket from outlet
3. Time how long to fill (use phone timer)
4. Calculate: **Liters per minute (LPM)** = Bucket volume / Time in minutes
5. Convert to GPM: LPM ÷ 3.785 = GPM

**Example:**
- 20 liter bucket fills in 30 seconds (0.5 minutes)
- 20 / 0.5 = 40 LPM
- 40 / 3.785 = 10.6 GPM

**Record:**
- [ ] Bucket volume: _____ liters
- [ ] Fill time: _____ seconds
- [ ] **Flow rate: _____ LPM / _____ GPM**

**Method 2: Hose Length Method (Rough Estimate)**
- Measure how far water sprays from outlet (feet)
- Strong flow = 15-20 ft spray = 15-25 GPM (5 HP pump typical)
- Medium flow = 10-15 ft spray = 10-15 GPM (3 HP pump typical)
- Weak flow = 5-10 ft spray = 5-10 GPM (undersized or old pump)

**Why Critical:** Tells us if pump can meet your permaculture needs (target: 20-30 GPM for 4 families)

- [ ] **Dynamic water level:** _____ feet (water level when pumping)
- [ ] **Year drilled:** _____
- [ ] **Recharge rate:** Good / Moderate / Slow (how fast does it refill?)

**If no records, observe:**
- [ ] Does pump "pulse" or lose pressure during long runs? (indicates marginal recharge)
- [ ] Can pump run continuously for 4-6 hours? Yes / No
- [ ] Any water level drop noticed over years? (ask farmer)

**Why Critical:** Determines if tubewell can handle increased demand (4 families + irrigation)

---

#### 7. Pressure Test at Different Distances

**Equipment needed:** Long hose (or multiple hoses connected), pressure gauge (borrow or buy ₹500-800)

**Test Setup:**
1. Connect hose(s) to tubewell outlet
2. Run hose to different test points:
   - 100 ft away
   - 300 ft away
   - 500 ft away
   - 700 ft away (approximate house location)

**At each point, measure:**
- [ ] **100 ft:** Pressure _____ PSI, Flow (strong/medium/weak)
- [ ] **300 ft:** Pressure _____ PSI, Flow (strong/medium/weak)
- [ ] **500 ft:** Pressure _____ PSI, Flow (strong/medium/weak)
- [ ] **700 ft:** Pressure _____ PSI, Flow (strong/medium/weak)

**Interpretation:**
- 40+ PSI at 700 ft = **Current pump adequate**
- 30-40 PSI at 700 ft = **Current pump marginal, may need upgrade**
- <30 PSI at 700 ft = **Current pump insufficient, upgrade required**

**Why Critical:** Determines if pump upgrade needed (₹35,000-55,000 cost)

**Farmer Experience:**
- [ ] Does water work well for crops? Any crop sensitivity issues?
- [ ] Any scale buildup in pipes/sprinklers?
- [ ] Suitable for drinking? (farmer's opinion)

**Why Critical:** Determines if filtration needed for domestic use

## 📊 ASSESSMENT INTERPRETATION GUIDE

### Pump Capacity Assessment

#### Scenario A: 5 HP, 20-25 GPM, Good Pressure
**Status:** ✅ **ADEQUATE for permaculture system**
- Can handle 4 families + moderate irrigation
- May want elevated storage to reduce runtime
- No immediate upgrade needed
- **Action:** Proceed with 2-inch main line design

#### Scenario B: 3 HP, 10-15 GPM, Medium Pressure
**Status:** ⚠️ **MARGINAL - Upgrade Recommended**
- Sufficient for current field, but undersized for 4 families + irrigation
- Will struggle to fill elevated tank quickly
- Long runtimes = higher electricity costs
- **Action:** Budget for 5-7.5 HP pump upgrade in Phase 1 (₹35,000-55,000)

#### Scenario C: 7.5-10 HP, 30+ GPM, Strong Pressure
**Status:** ✅✅ **EXCELLENT - Oversized (Good Thing!)**
- More than adequate for all needs
- Quick tank filling, low runtimes
- Excellent pressure throughout system
- **Action:** Proceed with confidence, no upgrade needed

---

### Bore Well Capacity Assessment

#### Scenario A: Good Recharge, No Pulsing, Runs 6+ Hours Continuously
**Status:** ✅ **ADEQUATE for increased demand**
- Can handle 4 families (2,800-4,600 L/day domestic)
- Plus irrigation (10,000-15,000 L/day peak summer)
- Total: ~20,000 L/day (5,280 gal/day)
- **Action:** Proceed with full system design

#### Scenario B: Moderate Recharge, Slight Pulsing After 3-4 Hours
**Status:** ⚠️ **MARGINAL - Monitor & Manage**
- Current agricultural use = continuous irrigation (one direction)
- Your use = intermittent (tanks, timers) = better for recharge
- **Strategies:**
  1. Elevated storage (10,000L) = fill at night, use during day
  2. Stagger zone irrigation (not all at once)
  3. Swale system critical (reduce tubewell dependence 60-70%)
- **Action:** Proceed, but implement water conservation aggressively

#### Scenario C: Poor Recharge, Significant Pressure Loss, Can't Run >2 Hours
**Status:** 🚨 **INSUFFICIENT - Major Concern**
- Will NOT support 4 families + irrigation without upgrades
- **Options:**
  1. Drill new tubewell near houses (₹1,00,000-2,00,000)
  2. Rehabilitate existing well (deeper bore, ₹30,000-60,000)
  3. Dual tubewell system (existing for irrigation, new for domestic)
- **Action:** Consult with borewell expert BEFORE proceeding
