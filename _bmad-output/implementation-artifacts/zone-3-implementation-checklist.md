  - [ ] Clear 4-foot wide path
  - [ ] Enable cart/wheelbarrow access
- [ ] **Southern access path:** Along Row 4/Swale 3
  - [ ] 3-foot wide maintenance path
  - [ ] Connects compost area to all zones
- [ ] **Cross paths:** Every 100-150 feet (E-W across rows)
  - [ ] 2-3 foot wide paths
  - [ ] Provides access to interior of long rows

---

### 2. SOIL ASSESSMENT & IMPROVEMENT

#### 2.1 Comprehensive Soil Testing
- [ ] **Sample collection:**
  - [ ] Collect soil samples from 10 locations (Zone 3 is long - need good spatial coverage)
  - [ ] Sample each row (Rows 1-4) + different distances E-W
  - [ ] Depth: 0-12 inches (topsoil) + 12-24 inches (subsoil)
  - [ ] Mix samples by row (4 composite samples)
- [ ] **Laboratory testing:**
  - [ ] pH (alkalinity is common in Kurukshetra)
  - [ ] NPK levels (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium)
  - [ ] Organic matter percentage (likely low from chemical farming)
  - [ ] CEC (cation exchange capacity)
  - [ ] Micronutrients (Fe, Zn, Mn, Cu)
  - [ ] Texture (sand/silt/clay ratio)
  - [ ] Salinity/EC (electrical conductivity)
- [ ] **Document baseline:**
  - [ ] Create soil profile document
  - [ ] Photograph soil samples
  - [ ] Note soil color, structure, compaction

#### 2.2 Soil Improvement Strategy (Based on Test Results)

**Common Kurukshetra Soil Issues & Solutions:**

**Issue 1: High Alkalinity (pH 7.5-8.5+)**
- [ ] **Solutions:**
  - [ ] Apply gypsum (calcium sulfate): 2-3 kg per 100 sq ft
  - [ ] Add sulfur (elemental or organic): 500g per 100 sq ft
  - [ ] Incorporate acidic organic matter:
    - [ ] Pine needles (if available)
    - [ ] Peat moss (expensive - use sparingly)
    - [ ] Well-decomposed leaf mold
  - [ ] Avoid lime-based amendments
- [ ] **Application timing:** 3-4 months before planting (allow time to work)

**Issue 2: Low Organic Matter (<2%)**
- [ ] **Solutions:**
  - [ ] Massive compost addition: 10-15 cm layer across Zone 3
  - [ ] Calculation: 29,260 sq ft × 10 cm = ~85 cubic meters compost needed
  - [ ] Source compost:
    - [ ] Farm-produced (start composting NOW)
    - [ ] Purchase from local sources (cow manure, vermicompost)
    - [ ] Municipal compost (if available and clean)
  - [ ] Green manure cover crops (before main planting):
    - [ ] Dhaincha (Sesbania) - fast-growing, nitrogen-fixing
    - [ ] Cowpea - nitrogen-fixing, edible pods
    - [ ] Guar (cluster bean) - drought-tolerant, nitrogen-fixing
  - [ ] Annual additions: 5-10 cm layer every year

**Issue 3: Compaction (Common after years of tractor use)**
- [ ] **Solutions:**
  - [ ] Deep forking or broadforking (entire Zone 3)
  - [ ] Use broadfork (15-20 inch tines) to break up hardpan WITHOUT inverting soil
  - [ ] Focus on: Future tree planting locations, annual crop beds
  - [ ] Avoid: Rotary tilling (destroys soil structure, kills soil life)
  - [ ] Biological tillage: Plant deep-rooted crops (radish, alfalfa)

**Issue 4: Nutrient Deficiency (NPK)**
- [ ] **Nitrogen deficiency:** Common in degraded soils
  - [ ] Immediate: Blood meal, fish emulsion, aged urine
  - [ ] Long-term: Nitrogen-fixing trees (Subabul, Gliricidia in Row 3)
  - [ ] Annual: Legume cover crops
- [ ] **Phosphorus deficiency:** Often locked up in alkaline soils
  - [ ] Rock phosphate: 1-2 kg per 100 sq ft
  - [ ] Bone meal: 500g per 100 sq ft
  - [ ] Mycorrhizal fungi (enhances P uptake)
- [ ] **Potassium deficiency:** Less common but possible
  - [ ] Wood ash: 200-300g per 100 sq ft (also raises pH - use carefully)
  - [ ] Greensand: Slow-release K source
  - [ ] Compost (contains K)

#### 2.3 Initial Site Preparation

**Timing: Months 1-3 (Before planting)**

- [ ] **Vegetation clearing:**
  - [ ] Remove invasive species (Lantana, Parthenium - PRIORITY)
  - [ ] Cut and remove excessive weed biomass
  - [ ] Chop and drop manageable vegetation (adds organic matter)
  - [ ] Leave beneficial native plants if any
  
- [ ] **Deep soil preparation:**
  - [ ] Broadfork entire Zone 3 (avoid tilling)
    - [ ] Work in 3-4 foot sections
    - [ ] Insert broadfork, rock back to lift soil, don't invert
    - [ ] Breaks compaction, maintains soil structure
  - [ ] Create microtopography (if drainage issues):
    - [ ] Slight ridges and swales within rows (6-inch height differences)
    - [ ] Improves water infiltration
  
- [ ] **Compost incorporation (Pre-planting):**
  - [ ] Spread compost layer (10-15 cm) across Zone 3
  - [ ] Focus on Rows 1-2 (trees + annual crops)
  - [ ] Lightly incorporate top 4-6 inches (don't bury deep)
  - [ ] Water in thoroughly

- [ ] **Green manure cover crop (Optional but highly recommended):**
  - [ ] **Timing:** Month 2-3 (if monsoon season)
  - [ ] **Species:** Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata)
    - [ ] Fast-growing (ready in 6-8 weeks)
    - [ ] Nitrogen-fixing
    - [ ] High biomass production
  - [ ] **Process:**
    - [ ] Broadcast seed or drill in rows (5-10 kg seed per acre)
    - [ ] Allow to grow for 6-8 weeks (before flowering)
    - [ ] Chop and incorporate into soil (top 4 inches)
    - [ ] Wait 2-3 weeks for decomposition
    - [ ] Ready for main crop planting
  - [ ] **Benefits:**
    - [ ] Adds 60-80 kg nitrogen/acre
    - [ ] Improves soil structure
    - [ ] Suppresses weeds
    - [ ] Builds organic matter rapidly

  - [ ] **Tubewell/borewell**: Backup (dry season)
  - [ ] **Grid water** (if available): Emergency backup

#### 3.2 Irrigation System Design

**Zone 3 Irrigation Needs:**
- Row 1 (Fruit Trees): **Drip irrigation** (efficient, precise)
- Row 2 (Annual Crops): **Drip or flood irrigation** (depending on crop)
- Row 3 (Biomass Trees): **Minimal irrigation** (drought-adapted, only establishment)
- Row 4 (Compost): **No irrigation needed** (moisture from materials)

**Recommended System: Drip Irrigation with Flood Backup**

#### 3.3 Drip Irrigation Installation (ROW 1: Fruit Trees)

**System Components:**
- [ ] **Main line:** 50mm PVC pipe along northern edge of Row 1
  - [ ] Length: 850 feet (full row)
  - [ ] Source connection: Pond pump or tubewell
  - [ ] Pressure: 1.5-2.5 bar (drip system requirement)
- [ ] **Laterals:** 16mm drip tubing (one per tree)
  - [ ] Perpendicular to main line
  - [ ] Length: 12-15 feet each (covers tree root zone)
  - [ ] Spacing: 8-10 feet apart (tree spacing)
  - [ ] ~80-100 laterals total (for ~80-90 trees)
- [ ] **Emitters:** Inline drippers (4 L/hour)
  - [ ] 3-4 emitters per tree (adjust as tree grows)
  - [ ] Spacing: 1-2 feet apart on lateral
  - [ ] Total emitters: 250-350
- [ ] **Filtration:** Sand filter + screen filter (essential for drip)
  - [ ] Prevents clogging (Kurukshetra water has sediment)
  - [ ] Install at water source (before main line)
- [ ] **Fertilizer injector (Venturi):** Optional but valuable
  - [ ] Allows fertigation (liquid fertilizer through drip)
  - [ ] Efficient nutrient delivery
- [ ] **Valves & controls:**
  - [ ] Main shutoff valve
  - [ ] Row control valves (section control)
  - [ ] Pressure regulator
  - [ ] End-of-line flush valves (clean system)

**Installation Steps:**
- [ ] Month 2: Order drip system components
- [ ] Month 3: Install main line (before tree planting)
- [ ] Month 4: Install laterals as trees are planted
- [ ] Month 4: Test system (check for leaks, pressure, even flow)
- [ ] Month 5: Begin irrigation (tree establishment)

**Cost Estimate:**
- Drip system for 80-90 trees: ₹25,000-40,000
  - Main line PVC: ₹5,000-8,000
  - Drip laterals + emitters: ₹15,000-22,000
  - Filter + fittings + valves: ₹5,000-10,000

#### 3.4 Flood/Furrow Irrigation (ROW 2: Annual Crops)

**Purpose:** Traditional irrigation for annual crops (wheat, vegetables)

**System Components:**
- [ ] **Field inlet:** Connection from Swale 2 or pond
  - [ ] Gravity-fed (if possible) or pump
  - [ ] Pipe or channel to Row 2

  - [ ] Spacing: 2-3 feet apart
  - [ ] Depth: 4-6 inches
  - [ ] Length: 836 feet (full row)
  - [ ] Created during bed preparation (easy to re-form each season)
- [ ] **Water management:**
  - [ ] Open inlet valve, water flows down furrows
  - [ ] Monitor to prevent over-watering
  - [ ] Rotate between sections (if zone too large for single irrigation)

**Advantages:** Low-cost, traditional, suitable for dense plantings  
**Disadvantages:** Less efficient (evaporation, runoff), labor-intensive

**Alternative: Drip Tape (for vegetables)**
- [ ] Temporary drip tape (reusable for 2-3 seasons)
- [ ] Roll out at planting, remove after harvest
- [ ] More efficient than flood, cheaper than permanent drip
- [ ] Cost: ₹5,000-10,000 for 15 ft × 836 ft area

#### 3.5 Water Access Points
- [ ] **Install hose bibs/taps:**
  - [ ] 3-4 access points along Zone 3 (every 200 ft)

  (30ft)  (18ft)  (28ft)  (18ft)  (30ft)  (15ft)  (12ft)
```

- [ ] **Mark locations on ground:**
  - [ ] Use stakes with labels (species name, variety)
  - [ ] Paint spots or use lime powder
  - [ ] Measure carefully (tape measure or measured rope)
  - [ ] Double-check spacing before digging pits

---

### 2. TREE PLANTING PREPARATION & EXECUTION

#### 2.1 Planting Pit Preparation (Month 5-6)

**Pit Specifications:**
- **Large trees (Mango, Jamun):** 3 ft × 3 ft × 3 ft (90cm cube)
- **Medium trees (Guava, Amla):** 2.5 ft × 2.5 ft × 2.5 ft
- **Small trees (Pomegranate, Ber):** 2 ft × 2 ft × 2 ft

**For each pit:**
- [ ] **Dig pit 4-6 weeks before planting** (allows soil to settle)
- [ ] **Separate soil layers:**
  - [ ] Topsoil (first 12 inches): Keep aside (nutrient-rich)
  - [ ] Subsoil (below 12 inches): Discard or use for berm making
- [ ] **Check drainage:**
  - [ ] Fill pit with water, observe drainage
  - [ ] Should drain within 24 hours
  - [ ] If poor drainage: Add sand, break up hardpan deeper
- [ ] **Prepare pit soil mixture:**
  - [ ] Topsoil: 50%
  - [ ] Well-rotted compost/FYM: 35%
  - [ ] Sand (if clay soil): 10%
  - [ ] Cocopeat or leaf mold: 5%
  - [ ] **Amendments per pit:**
    - [ ] Neem cake: 500g (pest deterrent)
    - [ ] Bone meal: 500g (phosphorus)
    - [ ] Rock phosphate: 250g (slow-release P)
    - [ ] Vermicompost: 2-3 kg (microbial activity)
  - [ ] Mix all ingredients thoroughly (use tarp or wheelbarrow)
- [ ] **Refill pit 75% with mixture:**
  - [ ] Leave top 25% space for tree root ball + final soil
  - [ ] Create slight mound (settles with watering)
- [ ] **Create water basin:**
  - [ ] Build 6-inch high earthen berm around pit (4-5 ft diameter)
  - [ ] Creates water-holding basin
  - [ ] Slope inward toward tree
- [ ] **Pre-planting irrigation:**
  - [ ] Water pit deeply 2-3 days before planting
  - [ ] Allows soil to settle and consolidate
  - [ ] Moistens soil for easier root establishment

#### 2.2 Tree Planting (Month 6-7 - MONSOON)

**Timing: First monsoon rains (June-July critical window)**

**Pre-planting (Day before):**
- [ ] Water all saplings in pots thoroughly (12-24 hours before)
- [ ] Stage saplings near planting locations (avoid mix-ups)
- [ ] Keep shaded (prevent drying out)
- [ ] Prepare tools: Shovel, water buckets, stakes, ties, mulch

**Planting Technique (Per tree):**

1. **Remove from container:**
   - [ ] Gently tap sides of pot (loosen root ball)
   - [ ] Turn upside down, support root ball, slide out pot
   - [ ] If root-bound: Gently tease out circling roots (score sides with knife)

2. **Inspect and prune roots:**
   - [ ] Remove damaged, diseased, or dead roots
   - [ ] Trim overly long roots (encourages branching)
   - [ ] Keep root ball intact as much as possible

3. **Place in pit:**
   - [ ] Dig final hole in prepared pit (size of root ball)
   - [ ] **Critical: Root collar at or slightly ABOVE ground level**
     - [ ] Use straight stick across pit to check depth
     - [ ] Planting too deep = common cause of tree failure
   - [ ] Graft union should be 4-6 inches above soil
   
4. **Backfill with soil mixture:**
   - [ ] Add soil around root ball in layers
   - [ ] Firm gently (eliminate air pockets, but don't compact heavily)
   - [ ] Fill to ground level
   - [ ] Create slight depression around trunk (water collection)

5. **Watering:**
   - [ ] Water deeply immediately after planting (30-40 liters)
   - [ ] Slow watering (allow infiltration, not runoff)
   - [ ] Water until basin is full and soaking in

6. **Staking (if needed):**
   - [ ] For trees >4 feet tall or windy locations
   - [ ] Drive 2-3 stakes outside basin (12-18 inches from trunk)
   - [ ] Tie tree loosely with soft material (jute, cloth strips)
   - [ ] Allow some movement (builds trunk strength)
   - [ ] Check every 2-3 months (loosen as tree grows)

7. **Mulching:**
   - [ ] Apply 4-6 inch mulch layer in basin
   - [ ] Keep mulch 4-6 inches away from trunk (prevent rot)
   - [ ] Use: Straw, dried grass, wood chips, or leaf litter
   - [ ] Mulch ring: 3-4 ft diameter initially, expand as tree grows

8. **Tree identification:**
   - [ ] Install permanent label (metal or UV-resistant plastic)
   - [ ] Record: Species, variety, planting date
   - [ ] Update planting map

9. **Initial pruning (optional, species-dependent):**
   - [ ] Remove damaged branches
   - [ ] Head back main stem to 4-5 feet (some species)
   - [ ] Establish scaffold branches (3-5 main branches)
   - [ ] **Mango:** Minimal pruning after planting
   - [ ] **Guava:** Prune to 3-4 feet, encourage bushy growth
   - [ ] **Pomegranate:** Prune to multi-stem form (3-5 stems)

#### 2.3 Species-Specific Planting Notes

**Mango:**
- [ ] Choose sunny, elevated location (excellent drainage essential)
- [ ] Orient graft union away from prevailing hot winds (west)
- [ ] Minimal pruning after planting (let tree establish)
- [ ] Stake securely (monsoon winds)

**Guava:**
- [ ] Tolerates partial shade
- [ ] Can be planted slightly closer (15 ft minimum)

  - [ ] Remove branches below 2-3 feet (future clearance for access)
  - [ ] Remove crossing or rubbing branches
  - [ ] Open center (improve light penetration and air circulation)

**Pruning Technique:**
- [ ] Use clean, sharp pruners (disinfect between trees with 10% bleach solution)
- [ ] Cut at 45° angle just above outward-facing bud
- [ ] Remove no more than 20-25% of canopy in Year 1 (avoid shocking tree)
- [ ] Seal large cuts (>1 inch diameter) with wound paste or paint

**Species-Specific Pruning:**
- **Mango:** Minimal pruning Year 1. Head back only if too tall. Shape in Year 2-3.
- **Guava:** Prune more aggressively. Encourage bushy, multi-branched form. Pinch growing tips.
- **Jamun:** Light pruning only. Naturally forms good shape.
