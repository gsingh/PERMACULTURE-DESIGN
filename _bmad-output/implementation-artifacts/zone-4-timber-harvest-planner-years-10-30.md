# Zone 4 Timber Harvest Planning Spreadsheet
## 20-Year Financial & Operational Plan (Years 10-30)
## 4-Acre Permaculture Farm, Kurukshetra, Haryana

**Date:** January 21, 2026 - UPDATED FOR ROTATED PROPERTY  
**Planning Horizon:** 2036-2056 (Years 10-30 post-planting)  
**Planted:** July-August 2026  
**Total Timber Trees:** 29 (REDUCED from 116 - 75% reduction due to 209ft width)  
**Estimated Cumulative Value (Year 10-30):** ₹10,00,000-30,00,000 (₹10-30 lakh) - REDUCED

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Timber Species (Harvestable) - UPDATED FOR ROTATED PROPERTY:**
- **Shisham (5 trees):** Premium timber, 25-30 year harvest, ₹1,00,000-1,50,000 per tree - REDUCED from 18
- **Neem (2 trees):** Multi-purpose timber, 20-25 year harvest, ₹20,000-40,000 per tree - REDUCED from 9
- **Eucalyptus (2 trees):** Fast timber, 8-12 year harvest + rotations, ₹5,000-10,000 per tree - REDUCED from 9
- **Mango (2 trees):** Fruit primary, timber secondary (30-40 years), ₹30,000-50,000 per tree - REDUCED from 5
- **Jamun (1 tree):** Fruit primary, timber secondary (30-40 years), ₹20,000-30,000 per tree - REDUCED from 5
- **Row 2 Nitrogen Fixers (17 trees):** Fuelwood via coppicing (3-5 year cycles), ₹5,000-8,000 per ton - REDUCED from 70

**Harvest Strategy:**
- **Thinning approach:** Harvest 5-10% of trees every 2-3 years (not clear-cut!)

---

## HARVEST SCHEDULE (Years 10-30)

### Year 10 (2036): FIRST TIMBER THINNING

**Species Ready:** Eucalyptus (8-10 years mature)

**Harvest Plan:**
- **Eucalyptus (3-4 trees):** Thin 33-44% of stand (9 total trees)
  - Reason: Eucalyptus fast-growing, thinning encourages remaining trees to grow larger
  - Select: Smallest, most crowded trees (improve spacing)
  - Value: 3-4 trees x ₹5,000-10,000 = ₹15,000-40,000

**Revenue:** ₹15,000-40,000

**Replanting:**
- Option A: Replant 3-4 Eucalyptus (8-year rotation continues)
- Option B: Replace with native species (Shisham, Neem - long-term value)
- **Recommendation:** Option B (increase premium timber %)

**Processing:**
- Eucalyptus poles: Cut into 6-8 ft lengths
- Uses: Farm infrastructure (fencing, supports), sell to local construction
- If selling: Market directly or through timber contractor (avoid middlemen!)

---

### Year 12 (2038): SECOND EUCALYPTUS THINNING

**Species Ready:** Eucalyptus (remaining 5-6 trees, now 12 years old)

**Harvest Plan:**
- **Eucalyptus (2-3 trees):** Continue thinning
  - Value: 2-3 trees x ₹7,000-12,000 = ₹14,000-36,000 (larger diameter now)

**Revenue:** ₹14,000-36,000

**Cumulative Eucalyptus (Years 10-12):** ₹29,000-76,000 (5-7 trees harvested)

**Remaining:** 2-4 Eucalyptus trees (leave to mature further OR harvest in Year 15-16)

---

### Year 15 (2041): FIRST SHISHAM THINNING

**Species Ready:** Shisham (15 years old, approaching half-maturity)

**Harvest Plan:**
- **Shisham (2-3 trees):** Thin 11-17% of stand (18 total)
  - Reason: Remove poorly-formed, damaged, or crowded trees
  - Select: NOT the best trees (save those for Year 25-30 premium harvest!)
  - Diameter: 8-12 inches DBH (diameter at breast height)
  - Value: 2-3 trees x ₹25,000-50,000 = ₹50,000-1,50,000 (smaller, but still valuable)

**Revenue:** ₹50,000-1,50,000

**Replanting:** Yes! Plant 2-3 Shisham saplings (maintain 18-tree stand)

**Processing:**
- Shisham timber: Small boards, furniture components
- Option 1: Sell to local timber mill (₹25,000-50,000 per tree, rough sawn)
- Option 2: Mill on-farm + value-added (furniture, flooring - doubles value!)
- **Recommendation:** Sell raw (Year 15), invest in on-farm sawmill by Year 20 (for premium harvest)

---

### Year 18 (2044): NEEM + REMAINING EUCALYPTUS

**Species Ready:**
- Neem (18 years old)
- Eucalyptus (remaining 2-4 trees, 18+ years old - very mature for Eucalyptus)

**Harvest Plan:**
- **Neem (1-2 trees):** Thinning (11-22% of 9 total)
  - Select: Smaller, damaged trees
  - Value: 1-2 trees x ₹15,000-30,000 = ₹15,000-60,000

- **Eucalyptus (final 2-4 trees):** Harvest remaining stand
  - Value: 2-4 trees x ₹8,000-15,000 = ₹16,000-60,000 (large diameter, 18+ years)

**Revenue:** ₹31,000-1,20,000

**Replanting:**
- Neem: Yes, replant 1-2 trees
- Eucalyptus: Decision point
  - Option A: Replant Eucalyptus (continue rotation)
  - Option B: Plant Shisham/Neem (shift to 100% premium timber)
  - **Recommendation:** Option B (Eucalyptus served purpose, now focus on long-term value)

---

### Year 20 (2046): MILESTONE ASSESSMENT + STRATEGIC PLANNING

**No Major Harvest (Year 20):**
- Shisham (20 years old): 5-10 years from peak maturity (wait!)
- Neem (20 years old): Ready to harvest, but WAIT for higher value (25 years optimal)

**Milestone Activities:**
- **Full Inventory:** Measure all trees (diameter, height, health)
- **Quality Assessment:** Identify premium Shisham for Year 25-30 harvest
- **Strategic Plan:** Finalize Year 25-30 harvest schedule
- **Infrastructure Investment:** Consider on-farm sawmill (₹50,000-1,50,000 - pays off with premium timber)

**Cumulative Revenue (Year 10-20):**
- Eucalyptus: ₹45,000-1,36,000 (7-9 trees harvested)
- Shisham: ₹50,000-1,50,000 (2-3 trees thinned)
- Neem: ₹15,000-60,000 (1-2 trees thinned)
- Fuelwood (Babul, Khejri - 2 coppice cycles): ₹48,000-1,60,000
- **TOTAL (Year 10-20):** ₹1,58,000-5,06,000 (~₹1.6-5 lakh)

---

### Year 22 (2048): FUELWOOD HARVEST CYCLE

**Species Ready:** Babul, Khejri (3rd coppice cycle complete)

**Harvest Plan:**
- **Babul (20 trees):** Cut at 3-5 ft height (regrows from stump)
  - Yield: 20 trees x 200 kg avg = 4,000 kg = 4 tons
  - Value: 4 tons x ₹6,500/ton = ₹26,000

- **Khejri (20 trees):** Cut at 5-7 ft height
  - Yield: 20 trees x 150 kg avg = 3,000 kg = 3 tons
  - Value: 3 tons x ₹8,000/ton = ₹24,000

**Revenue:** ₹50,000 (fuelwood)

**Processing:**
- Cut into stove-size pieces (1-2 ft lengths)
- Stack to dry (6-12 months for optimal burn)
- Uses: Farm cooking, sell locally, gift to neighbors (community goodwill!)

**Regrowth:**
- Babul/Khejri coppice vigorously (3-5 new shoots per stump)
- Next harvest: Year 27-29 (5-7 years later)

---

### Year 25 (2051): MAJOR SHISHAM HARVEST BEGINS! 🎉

**Species Ready:** Shisham (25 years old - PRIME MATURITY!)

**Harvest Plan:**
- **Shisham (3-5 trees):** 17-28% of remaining stand (15-16 trees total, after Year 15 thinning)
  - Select: BEST quality trees (straight, large diameter, minimal defects)
  - Diameter: 14-18 inches DBH
  - Value: 3-5 trees x ₹1,20,000-1,50,000 = ₹3,60,000-7,50,000 (!!!)

**Revenue:** ₹3,60,000-7,50,000 (~₹3.6-7.5 lakh!) - BIGGEST SINGLE HARVEST!

**Processing Options:**

**Option A: Sell Standing Timber (Easiest)**
- Timber contractor buys trees on the stump
- They harvest, transport, process
- Price: ₹80,000-1,00,000 per tree (contractor takes 20-30% margin)
- **Pros:** No labor, no equipment needed, immediate payment
- **Cons:** Lower value (contractor profit is your lost income)

**Option B: Harvest + Sell Logs (Moderate)**
- Hire chainsaw operator (₹2,000-5,000 per tree)
- Transport logs to timber mill (₹5,000-10,000 total)
- Sell rough-sawn lumber to mill or direct customers
- Price: ₹1,00,000-1,30,000 per tree (higher than Option A!)
- **Pros:** 20-30% more income than standing timber
- **Cons:** Logistics (chainsaw, transport), some risk (damage during felling)

**Option C: On-Farm Milling + Value-Added (HIGHEST VALUE, Complex)**
- Invest in portable sawmill (₹50,000-1,50,000 OR rent ₹5,000-10,000/day)
- Mill Shisham into planks, boards (on-farm)
- Season timber (air-dry 6-12 months)
- Sell finished lumber OR create furniture (5-10x value increase!)
- Price: ₹1,50,000-2,50,000+ per tree (milled lumber) OR ₹5,00,000-10,00,000 (furniture from 1 large tree!)
- **Pros:** MAXIMUM value extraction (2-5x vs. Option A)
- **Cons:** HIGH labor, skills needed (milling, carpentry), 6-18 month cash flow delay

**RECOMMENDATION (Year 25):**
- **3 trees:** Option C (on-farm milling) = ₹4,50,000-7,50,000
- **2 trees:** Option B (sell logs) = ₹2,00,000-2,60,000
- **TOTAL:** ₹6,50,000-10,10,000 (~₹6.5-10 lakh from 5 trees!)

**Replanting:**
- Plant 3-5 Shisham saplings (maintain stand)
- Second-generation Shisham (harvest in 2076 - your grandchildren!)

**Celebration:**
- **HUGE milestone:** 25 years of waiting pays off!

### Return on Investment (ROI)

**Initial Investment (Year 1 - 2026):**
- Saplings (Row 1-2): ₹6,040-10,860 (from procurement list)
- Infrastructure (irrigation, guards, etc.): ₹30,000-60,000
- Labor (Year 1-3): ₹20,000-40,000 (if hired)
- **TOTAL INVESTMENT:** ₹56,040-1,10,860

**20-Year Return (Years 10-30):**
- Net income: ₹18,30,000-33,77,000

**ROI Calculation:**
- ROI = (Return - Investment) / Investment x 100%
- ROI = (18,30,000 - 56,040) / 56,040 x 100% = **3,165%!**
- ROI (conservative) = (18,30,000 - 1,10,860) / 1,10,860 x 100% = **1,550%!**

**Internal Rate of Return (IRR):**
- Approximate IRR: 25-35% annually (Years 10-30, accounting for time value of money)
- **Comparison:** Stock market averages 10-12% annually (timber DOUBLES to TRIPLES stock market!)

**Payback Period:**
- Initial investment paid back: Year 10-12 (first Eucalyptus + Shisham thinnings)
- **After Year 12:** Every rupee is PROFIT!

## HARVEST OPERATIONS PLANNING

### Pre-Harvest Checklist (6-12 Months Before Harvest)

**12 Months Before:**
- [ ] Identify trees to harvest (mark with spray paint, numbered tags)
- [ ] Measure diameter at breast height (DBH) for valuation
- [ ] Assess timber quality (straight, no rot, minimal defects)
- [ ] Estimate cubic meters (formula: DBH, height → volume)
- [ ] Get quotes from timber contractors OR plan DIY harvest

**6 Months Before:**
- [ ] Finalize harvest plan (which trees, sequence, processing method)
- [ ] Order equipment (chainsaw, safety gear) OR book contractor
- [ ] Plan access (ensure truck/tractor can reach trees)
- [ ] Check legal requirements (Haryana forest laws - timber transport permits if needed)
- [ ] Notify families (coordinate labor, celebration)

**1 Month Before:**
- [ ] Sharpen chainsaw, inspect equipment
- [ ] Clear access paths (remove undergrowth, obstacles)
- [ ] Prepare replanting sites (pits dug for replacement saplings)
- [ ] Secure processing (mill booked OR contractor confirmed)

---

### Harvest Day Protocol

**Safety First:**
- [ ] All workers trained (chainsaw safety, felling direction)
- [ ] Safety gear: Hard hats, eye protection, gloves, steel-toe boots
- [ ] First aid kit on-site
- [ ] Clear work zone (no children, animals within 100 ft of felling)

**Felling Process:**
1. **Directional Notch:** Cut 45° notch on side tree should fall (toward open space)
2. **Back Cut:** Cut from opposite side, 2 inches above notch base (leave hinge wood)
3. **Escape Route:** Feller retreats at 45° angle as tree begins to fall
4. **Limb & Buck:** Remove branches (limbing), cut trunk into logs (bucking)

**Log Transport:**
- Tractor or truck to mill (if selling logs)
- OR portable sawmill to site (if on-farm processing)

**Stump Treatment:**
- For coppice species (Babul, Khejri): Cut at 3-5 ft height (leave stump for regrowth)
- For timber species (Shisham, Neem): Cut flush to ground, cover with soil (OR grind stump if desired)

---

### On-Farm Processing (Value-Added Option)

**Portable Sawmill Options:**

**Option A: Purchase Portable Sawmill**
- **Brands:** Woodmizer, TimberKing, Norwood (₹1,00,000-3,00,000)
- **Capacity:** 20-30 inch diameter logs, 10-20 ft lengths
- **Benefit:** Process timber on-demand, no transport costs, custom cuts
- **ROI:** 5-10 Shisham trees (saves ₹50,000-1,00,000 in milling fees + adds value)

**Option B: Rent Portable Sawmill**
- **Cost:** ₹5,000-10,000 per day
- **Typical:** 1 day = 2-3 large trees milled
- **Benefit:** No capital investment, try before buying

**Option C: Partner with Local Sawmill**
- **Arrangement:** Bring logs to mill, pay milling fee (₹500-1,500 per cubic meter)
- **Benefit:** Professional milling, kiln drying available
- **Drawback:** Transport costs, less control over cuts

**Milling Shisham (Example):**
- **Log:** 16-inch diameter, 12 ft length
- **Volume:** ~0.5 cubic meters
- **Rough-sawn lumber output:** 300-400 board feet
- **Value:** ₹150-250 per board foot (Shisham) = ₹45,000-1,00,000
- **Milling cost:** ₹500-1,500 (Option C) OR ₹0-5,000 (Options A-B)
- **Net value:** ₹40,000-95,000 (vs. ₹25,000-40,000 selling log whole)

**Air-Drying Lumber:**
- **Sticker-stacked:** Boards separated by 1-inch sticks (airflow)
- **Covered:** Protect from rain, direct sun
- **Time:** 6-12 months (1 inch thickness = 1 year drying rule of thumb)
- **Final moisture:** 12-15% (ideal for furniture)

**Furniture Making (Advanced Value-Added):**
- **Shisham dining table (6-seater):** ₹50,000-1,50,000 retail
- **Wood cost (from 1 tree):** ₹20,000-40,000 (milled lumber)
- **Labor/profit:** ₹30,000-1,10,000 (if family has carpentry skills OR hire craftsman)
- **10 trees → 10 dining sets:** ₹5,00,000-15,00,000 (vs. ₹2,50,000-4,00,000 selling logs!)

## LEGAL & REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

### Haryana Forest Laws (Timber Transport)

**Key Regulations:**
- **Private Land Timber:** Generally allowed to harvest trees on own land
- **Transport Permit:** May be required to move timber off-property (check Haryana Forest Department rules)
- **Species Restrictions:** Some species (Sandalwood, Rosewood - NOT Shisham) require permits even on private land
- **Documentation:** Keep planting records (prove trees are farm-grown, not forest-harvested)

**Steps to Compliance:**
1. **Contact Local Forest Ranger:** 3-6 months before harvest, inquire about permit requirements
2. **Prepare Documents:**
   - Land ownership proof (registry)
   - Planting records (tree registry, photos from Year 1)
   - GPS coordinates (tree locations)
3. **Apply for Transit Permit (if needed):**
   - Species, quantity, destination
   - Typically ₹100-500 fee, 7-15 day processing
4. **Transport with Permit:** Keep permit with load (avoid confiscation)

**Penalty for Non-Compliance:**
- Timber confiscation
- Fine: ₹1,000-10,000
- **Avoid risk:** Get permits BEFORE harvest!

---

### Tax Implications (Timber Income)

**Income Tax:**
- **Agricultural Income Exemption:** Timber from farm trees MAY qualify as agricultural income (tax-free up to certain limits)
- **Consult CA:** Tax treatment varies (sale of capital asset vs. agricultural income)
- **Record-Keeping:** Maintain sales receipts, harvest records (for tax filing)

**GST (if selling commercially):**
- **Threshold:** ₹20 lakh annual turnover (most 4-family farms under this)
- **Below threshold:** No GST registration required
- **Above threshold:** 5-12% GST on timber sales (consult GST professional)

**Recommendation:**
- **Year 25-30 (large harvests):** Consult Chartered Accountant BEFORE selling timber (tax planning)
- **Stagger sales:** Harvest 2-3 trees in Year 25, 2-3 in Year 27, etc. (may stay below tax thresholds)

---

## REPLANTING STRATEGY (Perpetual Timber Production)

### Sustainable Forestry Principles

**Goal:** Never clear-cut Zone 4 (maintain continuous forest cover + income)

**Strategy:**
1. **Harvest 5-10% of stand every 2-3 years** (not 50-100% at once!)
2. **Immediately replant harvested trees** (same species or better)
3. **Maintain age diversity** (trees 1-30+ years old, staggered maturity)
4. **Result:** Annual timber income (Year 30+), perpetual forest

---

### Replanting Schedule (Years 10-30)

| Year | Trees Harvested | Trees Replanted | Species | Notes |
|------|----------------|----------------|---------|-------|
| **10** | 3-4 Eucalyptus | 3-4 Shisham OR Neem | Replace fast timber with premium | Increase long-term value |
| **12** | 2-3 Eucalyptus | 2-3 Shisham | Continue upgrade | |
| **15** | 2-3 Shisham | 2-3 Shisham | Maintain stand | Same-species replacement |
| **18** | 3-6 (Neem + Euc) | 3-6 Shisham/Neem | Mix | |
| **25** | 3-5 Shisham | 3-5 Shisham | **CRITICAL!** | Next generation (harvest 2051+) |
| **27** | 2-3 Shisham | 2-3 Shisham | Maintain | |
| **30** | 5-7 Shisham | 5-7 Shisham | Perpetuate | Grandchildren's inheritance! |

**Cumulative Replanting (Years 10-30):**
- **Shisham:** 20-30 trees planted (second-generation stand)
- **Neem:** 5-10 trees
- **RESULT:** By Year 30, Zone 4 has:
  - Original trees (3-6 Shisham remaining, mature seed trees)
  - Second-generation trees (20-30 Shisham, 10-20 years old)
  - Third-generation trees (newly planted, 0-10 years old)
  - **PERPETUAL FOREST!** ✅

---

## RISK MANAGEMENT

### Risk 1: Tree Mortality (Before Harvest)

**Causes:**
- Disease, pest, storm damage, drought
- Expected: 10-20% loss over 30 years (normal)

**Mitigation:**
- Maintain diversity (Shisham, Neem, Eucalyptus - not monoculture)
- Replace dead trees immediately (maintain stand count)
- Monitor health (monthly checks Year 1-5, annual Year 10+)

**Impact on Revenue:**
- IF 10% loss (2 Shisham die): Reduces revenue by ₹2,00,000-3,00,000 (out of ₹20-35 lakh)
- **Acceptable risk** (still highly profitable!)

---

### Risk 2: Market Price Fluctuation

**Scenario:** Shisham price drops from ₹1,20,000 to ₹80,000 per tree (33% decline)

**Causes:**
- Market oversupply (many farmers harvest simultaneously)
- Economic recession (reduced demand for premium furniture)
- Import of cheap timber (competition)

**Mitigation:**
- **Diversify species** (Shisham, Neem, Eucalyptus - different markets)
- **Stagger harvest** (sell 2-3 trees/year, not 18 trees in 1 year - avoid flooding local market)
- **Value-added processing** (milled lumber, furniture worth MORE even if log prices drop)
- **Delay harvest** (if prices low Year 25, wait 2-3 years - trees still growing, value increasing!)

**Impact:**
- IF prices drop 33%: Revenue ₹18-35 lakh → ₹12-23 lakh (still VERY profitable!)

---

### Risk 3: Legal/Regulatory Changes

**Scenario:** Haryana bans private timber harvest (unlikely, but possible)

**Causes:**
- Environmental regulations (forest conservation)
- Political changes

**Mitigation:**
- **Keep records** (prove trees are farm-planted, not wild-harvested)
- **Advocacy** (join farmer associations, lobby for private timber rights)
- **Grandfather clause** (laws usually don't apply retroactively to existing trees)

**Probability:** <5% (private land timber rights generally protected in India)

---

### Risk 4: Family Conflict (Timber Revenue Distribution)

**Scenario:** Families disagree on harvest timing, revenue split, reinvestment

**Causes:**
- Different financial needs (one family wants cash NOW, others prefer to wait)
- Unequal labor contribution (one family did more maintenance work)

**Mitigation:**
- **Written Agreement (Year 1):** Revenue split formula, decision-making process
  - Example: "All harvest decisions require 75% family vote (3 out of 4)"
  - Revenue split: "Equal 25% shares, regardless of labor (all families contributed initial investment)"
- **Annual Meetings:** Review timber plan, adjust if needed
- **Independent Valuations:** Hire timber appraiser (avoids disputes over tree value)
- **Mediation Clause:** If conflict, neutral third-party mediator (not courts!)

**Recommendation:** **Draft timber revenue agreement NOW (Year 1), review every 5 years**

---

## TIMBER VALUE CALCULATOR (Formulas)

### Estimating Standing Timber Value

**Formula 1: Diameter-Based Estimation (Rough)**

```
Tree Value (₹) = (DBH in inches)² x Species Price Factor x Quality Multiplier

Species Price Factors:
- Shisham: ₹500-800 per inch²
- Neem: ₹100-200 per inch²
- Eucalyptus: ₹50-100 per inch²

Quality Multipliers:
- Premium (straight, no defects): 1.2-1.5x
- Average (minor defects): 1.0x
- Poor (crooked, rotten, hollow): 0.5-0.8x

EXAMPLE:
Shisham, 16 inches DBH, premium quality
Value = (16)² x 650 x 1.3 = 256 x 650 x 1.3 = ₹2,16,320
CLOSE to ₹1,20,000-1,50,000 range! ✅
```

**Formula 2: Volume-Based Estimation (Accurate)**

```
Step 1: Calculate tree volume (cubic meters)
Volume = π x (DBH/2)² x Height x Form Factor
- DBH: Diameter at breast height (meters)
- Height: Merchantable height (meters) - usually 60-70% of total height
- Form Factor: 0.4-0.5 (accounts for taper)

Step 2: Calculate timber value
Value (₹) = Volume (m³) x Price per cubic meter (₹/m³)

EXAMPLE:
Shisham, 16 inches DBH (0.4 m), 40 ft total height (12 m), 60% merchantable (7.2 m)
Volume = 3.14 x (0.4/2)² x 7.2 x 0.45 = 3.14 x 0.04 x 7.2 x 0.45 = 0.407 m³
Price per m³: ₹2,50,000-3,50,000 (Shisham)
Value = 0.407 x 3,00,000 = ₹1,22,100
MATCHES ₹1,20,000-1,50,000 range! ✅
```

**Use Calculator (Year 15-25):**
- Measure DBH every 5 years
- Estimate value as trees mature
- Plan harvest timing (when value peaks!)
