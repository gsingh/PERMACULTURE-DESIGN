### Passive Solar Design Features (All Houses)

**South-Facing:**
- **Large windows:** 60-70% of south wall glazed
- **Thermal mass:** Concrete floor or earth blocks (stores heat)
- **Overhang:** 1.5-2 ft projection (blocks summer sun, allows winter sun)
- **Cross-ventilation:** North-south window placement

**North Side:**
- **Minimal windows:** 10-20% of north wall glazed (reduce heat loss)
- **Insulation:** Extra insulation on north wall (hotter summers buffer)
- **Utility spaces:** Bathroom, storage on north (thermal buffer)

**West Side:**
- **Minimal or no windows:** West sun is brutal in summer
- **Shaded:** Plant trees or vines on west side
- **Thick walls:** Extra thermal mass

**East Side:**
- **Small windows okay:** Morning sun is gentler
- **Kitchen on east:** Natural light for cooking

**Roof:**
- **Reflective color:** White or light colors (reduce heat gain)
- **Insulation:** Min 6 inches (R-19 or better)
- **Ventilation:** Ridge vent + soffit vents (hot air escape)

**Cooling Strategies:**
- **Deep porch:** 6-10 ft creates outdoor living space
- **Ceiling fans:** Every room (reduces perceived temp 4-5°C)
- **Natural ventilation:** High windows + low windows create airflow
- **Deciduous vines:** On south porch (shade summer, sun winter)

**Individual House Systems:**

```
    HOUSE → Greywater Outlets
             (kitchen sink, bathroom sink, shower)
                    │
                    ▼
              Filter/Settling Tank
              (3-drum system, 50-gallon each)
                    │
                    ▼
              Distribution Pipes
              (to mulch basins or Zone 1 garden)
```

**Specifications:**
- **Collection:** Separate plumbing for greywater (not black water/toilet)
- **Filter:** 3-drum system (settling, filtering, distribution)
- **Distribution:** Drip or surface irrigation to fruit trees or gardens
- **Capacity:** 50-100 gallons per house per day

**Restrictions:**

- **Setbacks:** 100 ft from tubewell, 10 ft from property lines
- **Maintenance:** Pump every 3-5 years

**Investment:** ₹50,000-80,000 per house (₹2,00,000-3,20,000 total for 4 houses)

**Option 2: Shared Biogas Digester**

## LANDSCAPING & MICROCLIMATE

### Windbreak Trees (North Boundary)

**Location:** 5-10 ft north of houses (along property boundary)

**Species:** Shisham, Neem, Poplar (fast-growing, tall)
