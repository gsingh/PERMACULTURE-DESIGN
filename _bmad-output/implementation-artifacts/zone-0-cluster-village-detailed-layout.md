# ZONE 0: CLUSTER VILLAGE - DETAILED LAYOUT & SPECIFICATIONS
## 4-Family Housing Cluster with Common Hub
## Kurukshetra, Haryana - 209ft × 40ft Zone

**Date:** January 26, 2026  
**Revision:** February 7, 2026 - CRITICAL DISTANCE CORRECTION  
**Status:** DETAILED DESIGN - Ready for construction planning  
**Housing Option:** Option 1 - Cluster Village (RECOMMENDED)

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL CORRECTION (Feb 7, 2026)

**INCORRECT ORIGINAL:** Houses shown at 5-40 feet from north boundary  
**CORRECTED:** Houses at **65-80 feet (20-25 meters)** from north boundary

**Why Changed:**
- 3-layer windbreak system requires 65 feet (20m) depth
- Houses must be BEHIND windbreak for protection, not in front
- Original placement would provide NO wind protection
- Original placement risks foundation damage from tree roots

**All measurements in this document corrected to reflect proper 65-80ft placement.**

---

## 🌬️ DUAL WINDBREAK SYSTEM INTEGRATION (Feb 7, 2026)

**Property Configuration:** 209ft (E-W) × 836ft (N-S) creates TWO major windbreak systems:

| Windbreak | Specifications | Impact on Zone 0 |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| **Northern** | 209ft long, 65ft deep, 40 plants, ₹2.4k-4.7k | **Determines house placement** (65-80ft from north) |
| **Western** | 836ft long, 20ft deep, 350 plants, ₹20.8k-34.7k | **Enhances microclimate** for entire cluster |

**Combined Protection Benefits:**
- 🌡️ **Temperature moderation:** 3-6°C cooler in summer, 2-3°C warmer in winter
- 💧 **Water savings:** 30-40% less irrigation needed
- 🌾 **Crop protection:** 25-35% yield increase in protected zones
- ⚡ **Energy efficiency:** 20-35% reduction in heating/cooling costs
- 🌬️ **Wind reduction:** 70-80% of prevailing winds blocked/deflected

**Cluster Village Positioning:** Houses positioned centrally (50-160ft from west boundary) receive **MAXIMUM shelter** from BOTH windbreak systems - optimal microclimate for all 4 families.

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document provides **exact measurements, positioning, and specifications** for the 4-family Cluster Village housing layout within Zone 0. This is the final design ready for:
- Architect/builder handoff
- Building permit applications
- Site staking and foundation work
- Utility planning and installation

---

## ZONE 0 SPECIFICATIONS

**Total Zone 0 Area:** 209 ft (E-W) × 40 ft (N-S) = **8,360 sq ft (0.19 acres)**

**Location:** **65-105 feet from north boundary** (CORRECTED - behind windbreak)

**Windbreak Zone:** 0-65 feet (3-layer system protects houses)

**Orientation:** Houses face south for passive solar gain

**Primary Function:** Living spaces for 4 families + central common hub in protected microclimate

### Passive Solar Design Features (All Houses)

**South-Facing:**
- **Large windows:** 60-70% of south wall glazed
- **Thermal mass:** Concrete floor or earth blocks (stores heat)
- **Overhang:** 1.5-2 ft projection (blocks summer sun, allows winter sun)
- **Cross-ventilation:** North-south window placement

**North Side:**
- **Minimal windows:** 10-20% of north wall glazed (reduce heat loss)
- **Insulation:** Extra insulation on north wall (hotter summers buffer)
- **Utility spaces:** Bathroom, storage on north (thermal buffer)

**West Side:**
- **Minimal or no windows:** West sun is brutal in summer
- **Shaded:** Plant trees or vines on west side
- **Thick walls:** Extra thermal mass

**East Side:**
- **Small windows okay:** Morning sun is gentler
- **Kitchen on east:** Natural light for cooking

**Roof:**
- **Reflective color:** White or light colors (reduce heat gain)
- **Insulation:** Min 6 inches (R-19 or better)
- **Ventilation:** Ridge vent + soffit vents (hot air escape)

**Cooling Strategies:**
- **Deep porch:** 6-10 ft creates outdoor living space
- **Ceiling fans:** Every room (reduces perceived temp 4-5°C)
- **Natural ventilation:** High windows + low windows create airflow
- **Deciduous vines:** On south porch (shade summer, sun winter)
