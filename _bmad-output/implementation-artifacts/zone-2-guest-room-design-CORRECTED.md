- [ ] Create gentle grade for drainage (slope away from structure to east)
- [ ] Mark utilities: Water line tap-in point, greywater outlet
- [ ] Test soil bearing capacity
- [ ] Photograph existing conditions

**Access Path:**
- [ ] **Primary path (from main housing):** 
  - Route: From Zone 0/1 → along central spine OR eastern edge → Zone 2B SE corner
  - Distance: ~250-300 ft

**Material:** Brick or stone rubble with cement mortar  
**Height:** 18 inches above grade  
**Features:** Ventilation gaps every 6 feet (airflow under floor)  
**Cost:** ₹25,000-35,000

---

### Frame & Structure

**Material:** Bamboo poles (4-6 inch diameter) OR recycled wood  
**Treatment:** Natural preservative (neem oil, borax solution)  
**Design:** Post-and-beam construction (simple, strong)  
**Cost:** ₹35,000-50,000

---

### Walls

**RECOMMENDED:** Adobe/mud brick with lime plaster

**Why Adobe:**
- Excellent thermal mass (stays cool in summer, warm in winter)
- Natural, breathable (prevents moisture buildup)
- Beautiful texture
- Locally available materials
- Cost-effective

**Specifications:**
- **Thickness:** 12 inches (optimal thermal performance)
- **Brick size:** 9×4×3 inches (traditional)
- **Plaster:** Lime plaster (3/4 inch) with natural pigments
- **Cost:** ₹40,000-60,000

**Alternatives:**
- Compressed earth blocks (CEB): ₹50,000-70,000 (more water-resistant)
- Bamboo mat walls with mud plaster: ₹30,000-45,000 (most sustainable, less durable)

---

### Roof

**Recommended:** Mangalore tiles (terracotta)

**Why Mangalore Tiles:**
- Natural cooling (terracotta breathes)
- Durable (50+ years lifespan)
- Aesthetically pleasing (traditional look)
- Monsoon-proof

**Specifications:**
- **Structure:** Bamboo/wood rafters
- **Slope:** 30-40 degrees (rapid rain runoff)
- **Overhang:** 3-4 feet (protects walls, provides shade)
- **Insulation:** 3-4 inch layer rice husk or coconut coir (under tiles)
- **Cost:** ₹60,000-80,000

**Alternative:** Corrugated metal with insulation
- Pros: More affordable, excellent rainwater harvesting
- Cons: Noisier in rain, less aesthetic
- Cost: ₹35,000-50,000

---

### Flooring

**Material:** Polished oxide or natural stone  
**Color:** Earth tones (terracotta, sandstone)

---

## 4. CLIMATE-RESPONSIVE FEATURES

### Passive Cooling (Summer: 40-45°C)

**Design Strategies:**

**1. Orientation:**
- East-facing windows: Morning sun only (cool)
- West-facing veranda: Blocks afternoon sun (hottest)
- North-facing sitting area: No direct sun (coolest)

**2. Natural Ventilation:**
- Cross-ventilation: East windows → West door (prevailing breeze)
- Stack effect: High vents near ceiling (hot air escapes)
- Night ventilation: Open all windows at night (cool thermal mass)

**3. Thermal Mass:**
- 12-inch adobe walls: Absorb heat during day, release at night (8-10 hour delay)
- Stone flooring: Stays cool naturally
- Result: Indoor temp 4-7°C cooler than outside (comfortable even at 42°C with ceiling fan)

**4. Shade:**
- 3-4 ft roof overhang: No direct sun on walls
- Food forest canopy: Dappled shade around structure
- Deciduous trees on south/west: Summer shade, winter sun

**5. Evaporative Cooling:**
- Clay water pots (traditional surahi): Guests can drink cool water (natural evaporative cooling)
- Wet bamboo curtains: Optional on veranda (extreme heat days)

**Expected Performance:**
- **Outdoor:** 45°C
- **Indoor (passive only):** 38-40°C
- **Indoor (passive + ceiling fan):** Feels like 32-34°C
- **NO AIR CONDITIONING NEEDED** (guest experience: "surprisingly comfortable!")

---

### Monsoon Protection (July-September)

**Water Management:**

**1. Roof Design:**
- Steep pitch (30-40°): Rapid runoff (no pooling)
- Large overhang: Walls stay dry
- Sealed joints: Zero leaks

**2. Rainwater Harvesting:**
- **Roof area:** 16 ft × 26 ft = 416 sq ft
- **Annual rainfall:** 450-600mm (18-24 inches)
- **Collection potential:** 416 sq ft × 2 ft (avg) × 7.48 gal/cu ft = 6,223 gallons = 23,560 liters
- **Actual capture:** 80% efficiency = 18,848 liters/year

**System:**
- Gutters on all roof edges
- Downpipes to 3,000-liter tank (2 tanks if budget allows)
- First-flush diverter (prevents contamination)
- Overflow to Zone 2 food forest (irrigation)
- Cost: ₹20,000-30,000

**3. Drainage:**
- Site graded 2% slope away from structure (to east)
- French drains around foundation (if needed in clay soil)
- Greywater to banana circle (50 ft away, slightly lower elevation)

**4. Moisture Protection:**
- Raised plinth: Above monsoon water level
- Damp-proof course: Below wall level (plastic sheet or tar)
- Lime plaster: Breathable (prevents moisture trap)

---

### Winter Comfort (December-February: 5-15°C)

**Warmth Strategies:**

**1. Solar Gain:**
- Large east/south windows: Maximum winter sun
- Thermal mass: Stores daytime heat, releases at night

**2. Insulation:**
- Roof insulation: 3-4 inch rice husk layer
- Thick walls: 12-inch adobe (natural insulation)

**3. Thermal Comfort:**
- Heavy curtains: Close at night (retain heat)
- Warm bedding: Quilts provided
- Hot water bottles: Traditional method (if guests want)

**Note:** Kurukshetra winters are mild (5-15°C) - passive heating usually sufficient. Small backup heater can be provided (optional).

---

## 5. UTILITIES & SYSTEMS

### Water Supply

**Primary Source:** Zone 2 water system (tapped from Swale 1 or pond)

**Infrastructure:**
- [ ] Water line: 3/4 inch underground pipe
  - Route: From main Zone 2 water source → guest room (200-250 ft)
  - Buried: 18-24 inches deep
  - Cost: ₹8,000-12,000
  
- [ ] Storage tank: 500-liter overhead tank
  - Mounted on 10 ft platform (gravity-fed pressure)
  - Supplies shower, sink
  - Cost: ₹6,000-10,000
  
- [ ] Rainwater harvesting: 3,000-liter ground tank
  - Primary source for guest room (monsoon to winter)
  - Backup: Main farm water
  - Cost: ₹20,000-30,000

**Daily Water Needs (2 guests):**
- Drinking/cooking: 10 liters
- Shower: 60-80 liters (2 guests × 30-40 L each)
- Sink: 10-20 liters
- **Total:** ~80-110 liters/day

**Annual needs:** 80-110 L/day × 100 days occupancy = 8,000-11,000 liters/year  
**Rainwater provides:** 18,848 liters/year  
**Result:** 100% water-independent! (with overflow to spare)

---

### Wastewater Management

**Greywater System (Shower + Sink):**

**Design:**
```
Shower + Sink Drain
  ↓
Grease trap (if kitchen sink added)
  ↓
Sand filter bed (basic filtration)
  ↓
Mulch basin (final treatment)
  ↓
BANANA CIRCLE (50 ft from guest room)
  - 6-8 banana plants in circle
  - Central greywater pit (3×3×2 ft)
  - Mulch layers (woodchips, straw)
  - Plants uptake nutrients
  - Natural filtration
```

**Cost:** ₹12,000-18,000

**Banana Circle Production:**
- 6-8 banana plants
- Annual yield: 50-100 kg bananas
- Value: ₹5,000-10,000/year
- **Greywater becomes food!**

---

**Blackwater System (Toilet):**

**RECOMMENDED: Composting Toilet**

**Why Composting:**

- Produces compost (fertilizer for food forest)
- No septic tank needed (no pumping, no smell)
- Educational for guests (sustainable living demonstration)
- Off-grid compatible

**System:** Nature's Head or similar

**How it works:**
- Urine diverted (separate container, diluted 10:1, used as fertilizer)
- Solids mixed with coconut coir (carbon material)
- Vent pipe removes odor (24/7 ventilation)
- Crank handle turns compost
- Empty every 3-6 months (depends on use)
- Finished compost: 12-24 months curing → safe fertilizer

**Cost:** ₹25,000-40,000 (quality unit)

**Alternative:** Septic system
- 1,000-liter tank + leach field
- Requires pumping every 3-5 years
- Cost: ₹30,000-50,000
- **Not recommended** (less sustainable, higher maintenance)
