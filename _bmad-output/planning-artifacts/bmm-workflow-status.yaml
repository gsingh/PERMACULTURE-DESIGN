# Project metadata - UPDATED FOR ROTATED PROPERTY
metadata:
  land_size: "4 acres"
  land_dimensions: "209 feet (E-W) x 836 feet (N-S) - ROTATED from original"
  property_rotation: "90 degrees - width and length swapped"
  families: 4
  climate: "Semi-arid, hot summers (40°C+), cool winters (5-10°C)"
  water_source: "1 tubewell with electricity"
  soil_condition: "Alkaline, recovering from chemical farming"
  
  # Design decisions locked in - UPDATED:
  housing_layout: "Cluster Village (Option 1 RECOMMENDED) - 4 houses in 2x2 with central hub"
  housing_location: "Northern portion (0-40 ft from north boundary)"
  housing_arrangement: "2x2 cluster with common hub center, fits 209ft width comfortably"
  swale_count: "12-14 (INCREASED from 3) - cascade system"
  swale_locations: 
    - "Swale 1: 110 ft from north"
    - "Swale 2: 160 ft from north"
    - "Swale 3-12: Every 50-60ft down property (cascade)"
  swale_length: "209 feet each (shorter but more swales)"
  pond_location: "Zone 2B production pond at 245 ft from north (SE corner) - RELOCATED from Zone 5"
  pond_relocation_reason: "Zone 5 requires zero management, but pond needs daily duck access and fish farming - fundamental contradiction resolved"
  windbreak: 
    - "Northern: 209ft length (SHORTER - ~40 plants)"
    - "Western: 836ft length (LONGER - ~350 plants) - PRIMARY windbreak"
  
  # Zones defined - UPDATED:
  zone_0: "Houses (4 families, 2×2 cluster arrangement with central hub) - 0.19 acres (0-40 ft from north)"
  zone_1: "Kitchen gardens (40-110 ft) - 0.34 acres total: Private strips (52×30ft each) + Shared garden (209×40ft). Production: 1,500 kg/family/year. Investment: ₹21,500-31,550 per family Year 1."
  zone_2: "Food forest + Animals (110-310 ft) - 0.96 acres, 110-140 trees, 20-25 chickens, 12-15 ducks, Production Pond at 245 ft (30 ft diameter, 35,000 gallons)"
  zone_3: "Annual crops + Orchards (310-455 ft) - 0.70 acres (40-50 fruit trees, 0.29 acres annual crops, 32-40 biomass trees)"
  zone_4: "Perimeter/Timber (455-700 ft) - 1.05 acres, 200-250 trees (eucalyptus, poplar, teak, bamboo)"
  zone_5: "Wilderness (700-836 ft) - 0.65 acres, seasonal wetland (natural formation), ZERO management"
  
  # Key changes summary:
  rotation_impact:
    - "Zones now 75% smaller in E-W direction (209ft vs 836ft)"
    - "Property extends deeper N-S (836ft vs 209ft)"
    - "Main circulation changed from E-W to N-S"
    - "Multiple swales create cascade water system"
    - "Western windbreak now primary (4x longer)"
    - "Cluster Village (Option 1) recommended for best social cohesion"
