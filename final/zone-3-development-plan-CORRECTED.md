## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Zone 3 Location**: 560-705 feet from north boundary (between Swale 2 and Swale 3)  
**Primary Function**: Main production areas - fruit orchards, annual crops, grazing, biomass  
**Dimensions**: 209 feet (E-W) × 145 feet (N-S) = 30,305 sq ft = **0.70 acres**  
**Design Approach**: High production with moderate maintenance (2-3 visits/week)  
**Integration:** Connects Zone 2 (food forest/animals) to Zone 4 (perimeter/timber)

**Note:** Zone 3 has shifted 250 ft south due to Zone 0, 1, & 2 expansions, but maintains same area and production capacity. Major benefit: NOW MUCH CLOSER TO POND (75-220 ft vs 325-470 ft) for gravity-fed irrigation!

**Key Features:**
- Established fruit orchards (40-50 mature trees producing)
- Annual crop rotation areas (wheat, millets, vegetables)
- Managed grazing zones (optional goats, rotational)
- Biomass production (chop-and-drop nitrogen fixers)
- Large compost production areas
- Seasonal vegetable fields (3-4 crops/year)

### Chop-and-Drop Protocol

**Timing:** 4-6 cuts per year (varies by species)
- **Subabul, Gliricidia:** Every 60-90 days (4-6 cuts/year)
- **Moringa:** Every 45-60 days (6-8 cuts/year)
- **Sesbania:** Every 60-75 days (5-6 cuts/year)

**Method:**
1. Cut branches at 3-5 ft height (coppicing)
2. Strip leaves (fodder for animals OR compost)
3. Chop stems into 1-2 ft pieces
4. Apply as mulch to Rows 1 & 2 (4-6 inch layer)
5. Residue to compost system

**Annual Production:**
- 32-40 trees × 100-150 kg/tree/year = **3,200-6,000 kg biomass/year** = 3.2-6 tons
- PLUS leaves (separate): 1,000-2,000 kg/year (fodder or compost)
- **Total biomass:** 5-10 tons/year ✓ MATCHES TARGET

```

**Capacity:** Each bay 4 ft × 4 ft × 4 ft = 64 cu ft ≈ 2.4 cubic yards

**Annual Production:**
- 3 bays × 4 cycles/year × 2.4 cu yd/cycle = **28.8 cubic yards/year**
- Less shrinkage (~50%): **14.4 cubic yards finished compost/year**
- **Exceeds target of 10-15 cu yd/year!** ✓

**Inputs:**
- Row 3 biomass: 5-10 tons/year
- Row 2 crop residues: 2-4 tons/year
- Zone 2 animal manure: 18 cubic yards/year (chickens + ducks)
- Kitchen scraps (4 families): ~500 kg/year
- **Total:** 8-15 tons organic matter/year → 10-15 cu yd finished compost

**Compost Recipe (by volume):**
- 40% greens (nitrogen): Fresh manure, green leaves, kitchen scraps
- 40% browns (carbon): Dried leaves, straw, wood chips
- 20% soil (inoculant): Garden soil, old compost

**Management:**
- **Bay 1:** Add materials weekly (layer greens + browns)
- **Bay 2:** Turn weekly (aerate, maintain heat)
- **Bay 3:** Cure 2-4 weeks (stabilize, ready to use)
- **Every 6-8 weeks:** Bay 1 → Bay 2, Bay 2 → Bay 3, Bay 3 → application

### Optional Goat Grazing Integration

**IF families decide to add goats (Year 2-3+):**

**Goat Capacity in Row 3:**
- **Area available for grazing:** ~5,000 sq ft (southern section, around compost)
- **Stocking rate:** 1 goat per 2,500-5,000 sq ft (rotational)
- **Goat capacity:** 1-2 goats in Row 3 rotation

**Rotation Protocol:**
- **Week 1-2:** Goats in Row 3 western half
- **Week 3-4:** Goats in Row 3 eastern half
- **Cycle repeats** (each section rests 2 weeks)

**Fencing (CRITICAL for goats):**
- 4-foot woven wire fence + electric wire at top (12 inches above)
- Strong posts every 8 feet
- **Goats escape easily** - fence must be goat-proof!

**⚠️ RECOMMENDATION:** Start with chickens/ducks in Zone 2. Add goats ONLY if:
1. All 4 families 100% committed
2. Proper fencing installed FIRST
3. Feed security established (Row 3 fodder + supplemental)

## 🎯 FEBRUARY 10, 2026 - ZONE SHIFT BENEFITS ANALYSIS

### **POSITIVE IMPACTS - MAJOR IRRIGATION IMPROVEMENT!**

1. **✅ POND PROXIMITY DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED:**
   - **Original distance:** 325-470 ft to pond
   - **New distance:** **75-220 ft to pond**
   - **Impact:** 50-75% SHORTER - GAME CHANGER for irrigation!
   
2. **Gravity-Fed Irrigation NOW HIGHLY EFFICIENT:**
   - Pond at ~780 ft elevation
   - Zone 3 at 560-705 ft = minimal elevation loss
   - Easy gravity flow to all three rows
   - **Benefit:** Reduced pumping costs, easier water management
   - **Fruit trees (Row 1):** Direct gravity-fed drip irrigation
   - **Annual crops (Row 2):** Flood/furrow irrigation from pond overflow
   - **Biomass area (Row 3):** Occasional supplemental irrigation

3. **Better Integration with Pond Ecosystem:**
   - Duck-fertilized pond water → Zone 3 irrigation
   - Nutrient-rich water = natural fertilization
   - **Value:** ₹5,000-10,000/year saved on fertilizers

### **MANAGEABLE ADJUSTMENTS:**

1. **⚠️ Access Distance Increased:**
   - **Original:** ~245-310 ft from houses
   - **New:** ~410-495 ft from houses
   - **Extra walk:** ~165 ft (~2 minutes)
   - **Acceptable:** Zone 3 = 2-3 visits/week (not daily like Zone 2)
   - **Solution:** Well-defined path through Zones 1 & 2

2. **Tubewell Connection Longer:**
   - Backup water source now ~450-500 ft away
   - Primary irrigation from pond (closer), so less critical
   - One-time infrastructure cost: +₹8,000-12,000

### **NET ASSESSMENT: MASSIVELY POSITIVE ✅✅✅**

**Why this shift is EXCELLENT for Zone 3:**
- Pond proximity improvement = **single biggest benefit** of entire zone reorganization
- Gravity-fed irrigation from nutrient-rich pond water
- Reduced operational costs (less pumping)
- Better water security
- Weekly visits = access distance increase is negligible

**The zone shift gives Zone 3 exactly what it needs most: EASY WATER ACCESS!**

---

**Zone 3 is where permaculture theory becomes FOOD ON THE TABLE.**

**In Year 5, when you harvest your first mango from a tree you planted, or grind wheat into flour from grain you grew - that's when you know:**

**You're not just farming. You're FREE.**

---

**Document Status:** CORRECTED & UPDATED (Feb 10, 2026)  
**Dimensions:** 209 ft (E-W) × 145 ft (N-S) = 0.70 acres ✓
